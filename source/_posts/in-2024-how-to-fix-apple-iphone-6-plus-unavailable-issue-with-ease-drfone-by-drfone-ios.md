Account recovery is a process that can help you regain access to your Apple ID account if you don't have enough details to change your password or if you use two-factor authentication. The caveat? Account recovery can be lengthy and might take several days or longer. However, there are a few ways to expedite the recovery process:

- Confirm the six-digit code sent to your primary email address to prove that you're the account's rightful owner.
- Provide your credit card details. Apple will send an authorization request to your credit card issuer, which will help verify your identity.
