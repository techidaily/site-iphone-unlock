These devices have proven to be immensely popular among experts and fans alike. It has made understanding the intricacies of this groundbreaking series paramount.

## Part 1: What Is an Unlocked iPhone 15?

An unlocked smartphone, in essence, is a device that isn't tied to a specific carrier or network. Locked phones come pre-configured to work only with a particular carrier's SIM card. In comparison, unlocked phones provide users with the freedom to choose their preferred carrier. It also means they can switch between networks at will.

The Apple iPhone 6s 15 Series is renowned for its integration of cutting-edge technology. However, what truly sets the unlocked iPhone 15 Series apart is its unlocked status. It enables users to take control of their network choices and redefine their connectivity.

Purchasing an unlocked iPhone 15 isn't just about owning a high-end smartphone. It is a strategic decision that unlocks a plethora of advantages tailored to the modern user. Below are some compelling benefits that come with opting for an **unlocked iPhone 15 Pro Max**:

### 1\. Network Freedom

One of the standout advantages of an unlocked iPhone 15 is the freedom to choose any carrier. Users can easily switch between carriers. It allows them to select the one that offers the best coverage, pricing, and customer service. Thus, avoiding being restricted to a particular carrier's offerings.

### 2\. Global Accessibility

Unlocked iPhones are a traveler's dream. With an unlocked device, you can insert a local SIM card when abroad. It lets you sidestep the exorbitant international roaming charges. This feature allows you to maintain connectivity without constraints. This makes it an ideal companion for international adventurers.

### 3\. No Contracts

Locked smartphones often come with binding carrier contracts. These can extend for two years or more. With an unlocked iPhone 15, you can avoid lengthy contracts. It puts you in control of your financial commitments and enables you to change your plan as you see fit.

### 4\. Resale Value

Unlocked iPhones have a higher resale value than their locked counterparts. The broader appeal and flexibility of an unlocked device make it an attractive option. It is true for most potential buyers in the second-hand market.

## Part 3: What Are the Drawbacks of Buying an Unlocked iPhone 15?

Unlocked iPhone 15 Series presents a world of advantages. However, it's essential to approach any decision with a balanced perspective. Given below are the potential drawbacks associated with purchasing an **iPhone 15 Pro unlocked**:

Apple provides technical support for all iPhones. However, carrier-specific issues might be more challenging to resolve with an unlocked device. Carriers may prioritize support for their locked devices. It could potentially lead to delays or complications in addressing certain problems.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 6s with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 6s is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 6s Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 6s is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 6s from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 6s, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 6s and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 6s does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

## 5 Easy Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s without Passcode by Yourself

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the Find My iPhone function, then you can try it to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![use find My Apple iPhone 6s to unlock iphone 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.

**Step 3:** Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.

**Step 4:** Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone 6s from the list of devices.

**Step 5:** Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.

**Step 6:** Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 6s to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.

**Step 2:** Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.

**Step 3:** Once recognized, your Apple iPhone 6s will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 6s to the computer and launch the iTunes application.

**Step 2:** Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

**Step 3:** As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.

**Step 4:** On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.
