## Part 5. What To Do When iCloud Activation Lock Active?

Although IMEI Unlocking turns out to be quite an exceptional service, it generally is not the only thing that becomes a barrier for iPhone users. The iCloud Activation binds an Apple device to a user's Apple ID, making itself a great security measure. It presents a unique circumstance where services such as **doctorSIM legit** are inapplicable. [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) specializes in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock.

It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions.

Its remarkable performance includes the permanent bypass of the Apple ID lock.

### Notable Characteristics of Wondershare Dr.Fone

2. Wondershare Dr.Fone specializes in bypassing various screen locks, including passcodes and Face IDs.
3. Fone can remove the iTunes backup encryption lock without any impact on your data.

### Steps To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock via Wondershare Dr.Fone

Dr.Fone is intended for users locked out of their devices. Given below are the steps you need to follow when using Dr.Fone to bypass iCloud Activation Lock:

#### 1\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1

Click "Unlock Now" to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you'll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click "Got It!" after agreeing with all the mentioned points.

## Part 3: Can't Change Your Apple ID Password? Here's What You Should Do

It's happened to everyone: you try to change your Apple ID password, but something goes wrong. Maybe you get an error message or can't remember your current password. Whatever the reason, there are a few workarounds to change your Apple account password.

Change Your Apple ID Password on a New Device

Did you get a new Apple device or forgot your Apple ID password? No problem! Try these two things before and after setting up your new iOS device.

**Before Your Device Setup**

Click **Forgot password** on the Apple ID sign-in page on the web browser. This option is typically found during the setup process for a new Apple device or when you try to sign in to an Apple service on an unsigned-in device.

![reset apple id password on web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-07.jpg)

**After You Setup Your Device**

Need to create a new Apple ID or reset your password after setup? You can find the "Forgot password or don't have an Apple ID?" in your Settings app. Here's how to find it:

**On an iPhone or iPad**

For iOS users:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** application and tap **Sign-In** to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus or iPad.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Forgot password or don't have an Apple ID?** and follow the in-app guide to proceed.

![apple id forgot password on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-08.jpg)

**On a Mac Computer**

If you prefer to use your desktop:

- **Step 1:** From the Apple menu, go to **System Settings**.
- **Step 2:** Click **Sign in with your Apple ID** and click **Forgot password**.

![apple id sign in on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-09.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Follow the on-screen instructions to reset your password or recover your account.

Reset Your Apple ID Password Using a Family Device

Losing your phone or being unable to access your iOS device can be a major inconvenience. But it doesn't have to mean you're locked out of your Apple ID account. Even if you don't have your Apple device with you, you can still reset your password and get back to using your family's Apple devices.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Apple Support** app or download it from the App Store if not yet installed.
- **Step 2:** From the **Support Tools** section, select **Reset Password**.
- **Step 3:** Select **A different Apple ID** and tap **Continue.**

![select different apple id to reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-10.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Follow the in-app guide to reset your Apple ID password.

You can also designate a friend or family member you trust as your account recovery contact. They can help you reset your password if you forget it by providing a recovery code upon request.

![get account recovery code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-11.jpg)

Still Can't Change Your Apple ID Password? Try Account Recovery

The previous section showed you **how to change your Apple ID password** on any device if you cannot reset it. But what if you've tried all the steps in that section and you're still having trouble?

There's still one more option available: submit an account recovery request to Apple.

Account recovery is a process that can help you regain access to your Apple ID account if you don't have enough details to change your password or if you use two-factor authentication. The caveat? Account recovery can be lengthy and might take several days or longer. However, there are a few ways to expedite the recovery process:

- Confirm the six-digit code sent to your primary email address to prove that you're the account's rightful owner.
- Provide your credit card details. Apple will send an authorization request to your credit card issuer, which will help verify your identity.

![confirm credit card for account recovery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-12.jpg)
