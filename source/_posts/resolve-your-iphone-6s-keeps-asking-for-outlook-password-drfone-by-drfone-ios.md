## Part 1. Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking for Outlook Password

The **iPhone asking for Outlook password** arises from a combination of factors. Understanding these reasons is crucial in diagnosing and resolving the problem effectively:

### 1\. Incorrect Password Entry

Users might unknowingly enter the wrong password. They may have changed their Outlook password without updating it on their iPhones. This mismatch can trigger continuous password prompts.

### 2\. Outdated Mail App

An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone 6s may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone 6s keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

Upholding a stable internet connection is necessary for effortless communication. An unreliable or unstable network can disrupt the synchronization process in Outlook.

### 4\. Corrupted Email Account Profile

A corrupted email account profile on the Apple iPhone 6s can cause disruptions during the authentication process. Resetting the email account on the Apple iPhone 6s device might be necessary to resolve the issue.

### 5\. Third-Party App Interference

Other mail applications installed on the Apple iPhone 6s can also cause an issue. They might interfere with the Outlook app's proper functioning. Identifying and temporarily disabling such apps can help diagnose and resolve the issue.

Configuring the Outlook mail app to fetch emails too frequently causes the issue. It can strain the connection with Outlook servers, leading to authentication challenges. That causes issues like the Apple iPhone 6s asking for a password.

### 7\. iOS Software Glitches

## Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?

You can't remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn't currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.

Find out the steps below.

Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake

Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 6s screen with a simple tap. It's handy, but there's a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don't want any unexpected brightness.

Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to **remove the flashlight from lock screens**. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won't light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.

Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** or **General** > **Accessibility** on your Apple iPhone 6s device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off **Tap to Wake**.

![iphone turn off tap to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake

With "Raise to Wake" enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 6s. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you'll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.

Here is **how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens** when not needed:

- **Step 1:** Head to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off the **Raise to Wake** option.

Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center

The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and navigate to **Control Center**.
- **Step 2:** Tap on **Customize Controls**, then find the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 3:** Tap the red minus (**\-**) sign next to the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Remove** to confirm deleting the **Flashlight** icon from the **Control Center**.

![remove flashlight from iphone control center](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut

Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 6s lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone's back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.

Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won't accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here's how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Touch** > **Back Tap**.
- **Step 2:** Select the **Double Tap** or **Triple Tap** option you're using for the flashlight shortcut.
- **Step 3:** Choose **None** instead of the currently assigned action, which might be ****Flashlight****.

Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight

For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven't customized the Control Center. Here's **how to turn off the flashlight** with Siri on your Apple iPhone 6s:

- **Step 1:** Say **"Hey Siri"** or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Give the commands saying, **"Turn off the flashlight."**
- **Step 3:** Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You'll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.
