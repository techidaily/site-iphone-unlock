So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 7 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part 2: How to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 Plus passcode with Siri? (iOS 8.0 – iOS 10.1)

If you are an avid user of Apple products, then the chances are that you must have already heard of this Apple iPhone 7 Plus hack. If you are running a device on iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1, then you can take the assistance of Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 Plus lock.

You can follow these steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 Plus passcode with Siri.

**Step 1**. Firstly, hold the Home button on our phone to activate Siri. Speak a command like “Siri, what time is it?” to ask the present time. Now, tap on the clock icon.
