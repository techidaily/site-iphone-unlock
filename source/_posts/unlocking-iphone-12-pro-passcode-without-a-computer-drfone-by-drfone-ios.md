Just like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS), you can also use iTunes to fix the Apple iPhone 12 Pro won’t unlock the problem. Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone's.

## Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro without a passcode using iCloud?

2. From here, click on the “Find my iPhone” service.

## Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone 12 Pro?

Lately, there have been a lot of articles about this method. As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.

It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 12 Pro that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 12 Pro currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.

## Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 12 Pro X/Apple iPhone 12 Pro from being unlocked by thieves

It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 12 Pro from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.

**5.1 Enable Find my iPhone**

This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.

Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.

**5.2 Use Find my Friends**

Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.

In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg)

**5.3 Enable two-factor authentication**

Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings > Apple ID > Passcode & Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.

**5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts**

This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.

Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.

## Part 3: Tips for Successful Apple iPhone 12 Pro Unlocking

Unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro can be a delicate process. To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:

### 1\. Check Device Eligibility

Make sure your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.

### 2\. Backup Your Data

Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.

If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.

### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 12 Pro's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.

Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 12 Pro 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn't been unlocked during this time.

When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the computer.

## Conclusion

To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro can be daunting when you've forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues. Thankfully, there are different methods available to regain access to your device. This article explored three methods: using iCloud's Find My iPhone, restoring with iTunes, and utilizing Dr.Fone.
