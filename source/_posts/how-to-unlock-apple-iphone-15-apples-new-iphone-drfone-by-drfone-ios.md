## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 15 from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 15, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 15 and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.
