## Part 5: How to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini to Use USB Accessories without Passcode via iTunes?

There is currently no way to unlock an iPhone without erasing all data. Luckily, iTunes can help back up your data before removing it. Please note that this way is **only possible if the Apple iPhone 12 mini device has synced data in iTunes before.**

- **Step 1:** Connect Apple iPhone 12 mini to a computer with a USB accessory and turn on iTunes. Then iTunes will make a backup for your phone.
- **Step 2:** Choose “Restore iPhone”.

Wait for a while and you could unlock the screen to use USB accessories. However, in step one, you may need to enter your passcode to get stuck during the process. Therefore, this method is not the most efficient.

## Part 7: Hot FAQ about USB Accessories on iPhone

### Q1: What is the feature of USB Accessories on iPhone?

From USB-A to the latest, USB-C. Also, most iPhones use a proprietary Lightning port.

### Q2: Why does My iPhone Think My Charger is a USB Accessory?

It is related to the capacity of the charger. If a low-capacity charger is used, your device must regard it as a USB port because the USB port charges at a lower rate than a good wall charger. Another possibility is that the cable being used is flaky.

### Q3: What to Do If My iPhone Not Charging after Unlock to Use Accessories?

- **Step 1**: Disconnect your tool from the accessory.
- **Step 2**: Unlock your device.
- **Step 3**: Connect the USB accessory again.

If it doesn’t work, please contact customer service of Apple.

### Conclusion

It is very common to use USB accessories to connect iPhone and computer. Sometimes, we may forget the password, or cannot unlock the screen due to system failure. There are many ways to unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini to use the accessories in the article. Finally, we recommend everyone to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, a helpful and convenient tool.
