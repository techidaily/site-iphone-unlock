## Part 3. \[All Data Lost\] Trying Recovery Mode for Unlocking Stolen iPhone

Another lifesaver method to unlock stolen iPhones is by utilizing the Recovery Mode. For this purpose, users need to connect their iPhones to their PC using [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/). Its ability to facilitate data restoration makes it an effective method to unlock iOS devices. Rather than searching for “**I bought a lost iPhone how do I unlock it**,” simply follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1.** Connect your locked stolen Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the computer using a USB cable. To enter the Recovery Mode, you need to follow the steps below, depending on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus model:

- **For iPhone 8 and Later:** Press and release the "Volume Up" button, followed by the "Volume Down" button. Press and hold the "Side" button on the right side of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to activate Recovery Mode.
- **For iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:** Press and hold the "Volume Down" and "Side/Power" buttons to enable Recovery Mode in iPhone 7 models.
- **For iPhone 6 and Earlier:** To activate Recovery Mode, press and hold the "Home" and "Side/Power" buttons until the respective screen displays.

- **Step 2:** Once your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is in Recovery Mode, iTunes will detect it automatically. A pop-up window will appear within iTunes to detect some problems with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.

## Part 4. Using Third-Party Unlocking Service To Unlock Stolen iPhone

Below, we have outlined steps for using Apple iPhone Unlock to help you with **how do I unlock a stolen iPhone** issue:

**Instructions:** First, access the Apple iPhone Unlock official website and enter the IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Select the particular iOS device model and continue to select “Remove Activation Lock.” Following this, review the order summary and pay the fee with the required option. Upon successful completion of payment, the service will contact you for instant unlocking within 24 hours.
