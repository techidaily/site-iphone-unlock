- You should be wearing the Apple Watch on your wrist, and it must be unlocked.
- Your Apple iPhone SE (2020) should be upgraded to iOS 14.5 or above.
- The wrist detection on your phone should be activated.

To enable the feature of unlocking the Apple iPhone SE (2020) with an Apple Watch, the steps are:

**Step** **1:** Head to the " Settings " app and choose "Face ID & Passcode." Give your passcode for authenticity and proceed further.
