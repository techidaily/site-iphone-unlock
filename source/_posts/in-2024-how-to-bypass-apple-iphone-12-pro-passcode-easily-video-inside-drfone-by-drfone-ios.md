No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 12 Pro will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.
