Performing a force restart, also known as a hard reset, can troubleshoot minor software glitches. These can cause unresponsive swipe-up issues on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro. Here's a guide on how to perform a force restart on various iDevice models to fix the **iPhone won’t swipe up**:

#### For iPhone 8 and Later Devices

**Instructions:** Begin by moving your finger towards the left side of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro and tap on the "Volume Up." Then, release the button after some points. Proceed similarly with the "Volume Down" button. Then, navigate towards the right side and press the "Side" button there. Keep on forcing the "Side" button up until the screen shows the Apple logo. This will indicate that a force restart is initiated.

#### For iPhone 7 Series

**Instructions:** Begin by reaching both sides of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro at once. Press the "Volume Down" button situated on the left side using your left hand while simultaneously using your right hand to press the "Sleep/Wake" button on the right side. Stay firm with the grip on both buttons and release them when you see the signature Apple logo glowing on the screen. This will indicate that the force restart operation has been successful.

#### For iPhone 6 and Older Devices

**Instructions:** To restart your Apple iPhone 13 Pro 6, press the "Wake/Sleep" button on the top edge of the phone. Hold the other "Home" button at the bottom center screen of the phone.

### Fix 3. Remove the Cover or Case

Sometimes, an unresponsive swipe-up gesture on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro could be due to interference caused by a protective cover or case. The cover might be too thick, improperly aligned, or interfering with the touch sensitivity of the screen. Gently remove the protective cover or case from your Apple iPhone 13 Pro. Inspect the screen for any dust, debris, or smudges while the cover is removed. Utilize a clean, soft cloth to wipe the screen.

### Fix 4. Clean iPhone Screen or Remove Screen Protector

An unresponsive swipe-up gesture on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro might be due to dirt, smudges, or interference caused by a screen protector. Power off your Apple iPhone 13 Pro to prevent accidental taps during the cleaning process. Carefully clean the screen by softly rubbing it with a fresh and dry microfiber cloth. In addition, ensure the cloth is soft and free from any debris that might scratch the screen.

### Fix 5. Activate Control Center Access on the Lock Screen

If your Apple iPhone 13 Pro swipe-up gesture isn't working specifically on the lock screen to access the Control Center, it might be due to settings restricting its accessibility. Enabling Control Center access on the lock screen allows you to swipe up from the bottom edge. Follow these steps to ensure Control Center access is enabled on the lock screen and fix the **iPhone swipe up not working**:

**Step 1.** On your iOS device, access the “Settings” app and launch it. Now scroll down to find and tap "Face ID & Passcode."
