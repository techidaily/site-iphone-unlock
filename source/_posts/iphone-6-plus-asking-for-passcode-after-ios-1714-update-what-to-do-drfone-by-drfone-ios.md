## Apple iPhone 6 Plus Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 6 Plus displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2.** Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.

![android ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3.** You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4.** Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17/14.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5.** Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!

![ drfone advanced unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png)

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.

It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg)

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

![find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg)

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary

And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17/14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!

## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 6 Plus

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In

Sometimes, simply [<u>signing out of your Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html) and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the **Settings** app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to **Sign Out**. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.

Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure. Regularly checking your Apple ID settings and payment information can prevent many common issues with the App Store, including the frustrating ‘Verification Required’ prompt.
