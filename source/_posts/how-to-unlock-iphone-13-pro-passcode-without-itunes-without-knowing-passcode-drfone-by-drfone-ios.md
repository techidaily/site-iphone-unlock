Not so long ago, a computer was a necessity in every household for various reasons. Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPad.

You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled In Future

And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously.
