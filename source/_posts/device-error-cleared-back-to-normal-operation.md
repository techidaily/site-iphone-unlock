### Fix 2: Update your device driver

Driver errors like Code 22 can often be fixed by updating device drivers. You can do so via Device Manager, or go to the device manufacturer’s official website to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

### Fix 4: Reset the BIOS settings

If the above steps don’t work for you, to fix driver error code 22, you can try removing the CMOS battery to reset BIOS to its default settings, which sounds like an ultimate fix. It requires some skills. You can follow the instructions below:

1. Shut down your computer.
2. Disconnect all power sources (remove all cables).
3. Open up your computer’s case to reveal the hardware inside.
4. Find the CMOS battery.  
 On desktop PCs, the CMOS battery is usually located in an exposed housing on the motherboard (see an example below).

 Example – CMOS battery on a desktop PC  

 On laptops, finding the battery housing may be not as easy. Some models have a small pop-out tray on the chassis to enable easy removal. Some may be covered with something as protection (see an example below).

 Example – CMOS battery on a laptop

5. Remember which direction the battery is installed. Usually the engraved side, the positive side, is face up. Then, remove the CMOS battery from the main board (most can simply be popped out).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b98c58fd6ffe.jpg)
6. Wait for about one or two minutes for the CMOS to reset itself to its defaults.

7. Place the battery back in the housing, seal your computer’s case, and start your computer. Your BIOS should have reset itself, re-enabling your graphics device in the process.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b98c68d02c94.jpg)
