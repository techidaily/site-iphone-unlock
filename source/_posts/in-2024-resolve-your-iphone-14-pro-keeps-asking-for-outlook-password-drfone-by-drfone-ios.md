Individuals and organizations use a diverse range of mail platforms to exchange information. Gmail, Outlook, or any alternative service is consistently utilized. While email platforms have revolutionized communication, they aren't present without their challenges. Users often encounter issues that range from sync errors to authentication problems.

Among these challenges, iPhone users specifically grapple with a persistent issue. It often appears as “**iPhone keeps asking for Outlook password**.” This issue disrupts the user experience and raises security concerns. To address this problem, this guide presents a detailed guide featuring effective fixes.

## Part 1. Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking for Outlook Password

The **iPhone asking for Outlook password** arises from a combination of factors. Understanding these reasons is crucial in diagnosing and resolving the problem effectively:

### 1\. Incorrect Password Entry

Users might unknowingly enter the wrong password. They may have changed their Outlook password without updating it on their iPhones. This mismatch can trigger continuous password prompts.

### 2\. Outdated Mail App

An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone 14 Pro keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

Upholding a stable internet connection is necessary for effortless communication. An unreliable or unstable network can disrupt the synchronization process in Outlook.

### 4\. Corrupted Email Account Profile

A corrupted email account profile on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro can cause disruptions during the authentication process. Resetting the email account on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device might be necessary to resolve the issue.

### 5\. Third-Party App Interference

Other mail applications installed on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro can also cause an issue. They might interfere with the Outlook app's proper functioning. Identifying and temporarily disabling such apps can help diagnose and resolve the issue.

### 6\. Excessive Email Fetching

Configuring the Outlook mail app to fetch emails too frequently causes the issue. It can strain the connection with Outlook servers, leading to authentication challenges. That causes issues like the Apple iPhone 14 Pro asking for a password.

### 7\. iOS Software Glitches

The smooth functioning of the Mail app may be disrupted by problems and malfunctions present in the iOS software. Compatibility issues could emerge if your device is not operating on the latest iOS version.

Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.

## Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro without a passcode using iCloud?

Another way to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro without a passcode or Face ID is by using iCloud. Instead of turning off the Find my iPhone service, we will use it to erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device remotely. Though, you should know your Apple ID and password to implement this technique.

2. From here, click on the “Find my iPhone” service.

If you get a prompt on your phone regarding the respective actions, agree to it and wait for a while as your phone would be restarted. Since this will erase all the existing data on your phone, you can later use a backup file to restore the lost content.

## Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone 14 Pro?

Lately, there have been a lot of articles about this method. As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.

It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 14 Pro that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 14 Pro currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.

## Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 14 Pro X/Apple iPhone 14 Pro from being unlocked by thieves

It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 14 Pro from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.

**5.1 Enable Find my iPhone**

This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.

Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.

**5.2 Use Find my Friends**

Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.

In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.

**5.3 Enable two-factor authentication**

Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings > Apple ID > Passcode & Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.

**5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts**

This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.

Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.

When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements. Out of all the provided options, [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is recommended. This is because using the Dr.Fone toolkit is extremely easy. You won’t face any compatibility issues or need to have the technical experience to use this reliable tool. Try it for free and download it on your system to bypass a locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro right away.

## Apple iPhone 14 Pro Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 14 Pro displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2.** Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.

![android ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3.** You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.

![ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4.** Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17/14.

![ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5.** Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and use it without a lock screen!

That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!

![drfone advanced unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png)

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.

It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and use it without a lock screen!

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg)

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 14 Pro in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

![find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg)

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary

And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17/14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!
