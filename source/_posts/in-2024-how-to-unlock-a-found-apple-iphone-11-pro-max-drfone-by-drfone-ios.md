Nevertheless, external services claim to provide solutions for bypassing the Activation Lock, specifically on Apple Watches. One such service is provided by Apple iPhone Unlock. These are the steps to bypass the Activation Lock on the Apple Watch:

Next, enter the [IMEI number](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-phone-free-with-imei-number.html) of your Apple Watch and click "Unlock for any SIM Card." Afterward, follow the prompts on the screen to complete the process.

### Way 3. Unlocking Apple Watch Activation Lock by Contacting Previous Owner

By contacting the previous owner, you can request them to remove the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device from their iCloud account. Here's the procedure they can follow to unlock your Apple Watch, resulting in the Activation Lock bypass:

- **Step 1.** Access the [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) website via a web browser and sign in using the Apple ID. Click on the grid icon near the top right corner and select "Find My."
