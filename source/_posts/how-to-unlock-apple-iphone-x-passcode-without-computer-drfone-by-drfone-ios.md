That‘s it. Now, when you get a call and your Apple iPhone X 13 is ringing loud, looking at your Apple iPhone X 13/12/11 will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your Apple iPhone X. Additionally, your Apple iPhone X screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.

### II.IV Filling Passwords in Safari Automatically Using Face ID

Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your Apple iPhone X with Face ID.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.

Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.

Step 3: Look at your Apple iPhone X to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### II.V Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone X X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone X and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 13/12/11:

Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.

Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji/ Memoji you want to send.

Step 3: Tap the Record button and you now have 30 seconds to do what you want with your face and the character will reproduce it on screen for you.

Step 4: When done, the Record button changes to Send:

Tap Send to send your first Memoji/ Animoji.

## Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone X

For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.

Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone X 13/12/11 and set it again if you have put on some 'COVID weight' owing to working from home.

Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone X device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone X 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone X device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone X 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone X 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode.

Step 2: Scroll and tap the option "Reset Face ID" to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone X 13/12/11.

## Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone X

Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone X 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.

Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone X in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.

Step 5: When done, tap Done.

In case you are getting the following error:

![face id error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg)

There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone X 13/12/11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.

If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone X device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone X (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone X can be used solely with passcodes if you want. If you find that your screen is locked and you can‘t unlock it, you can always find help in tools such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS). So go ahead, use the new Face ID on your Apple iPhone X with confidence, and enjoy a more secure experience on your new iPhone than ever before.
