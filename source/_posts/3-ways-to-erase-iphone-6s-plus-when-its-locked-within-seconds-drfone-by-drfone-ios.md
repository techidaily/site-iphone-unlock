- **Step 3:** Follow the on-screen instructions to reset your password or recover your account.

Reset Your Apple ID Password Using a Family Device

Losing your phone or being unable to access your iOS device can be a major inconvenience. But it doesn't have to mean you're locked out of your Apple ID account. Even if you don't have your Apple device with you, you can still reset your password and get back to using your family's Apple devices.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Apple Support** app or download it from the App Store if not yet installed.
- **Step 2:** From the **Support Tools** section, select **Reset Password**.
- **Step 3:** Select **A different Apple ID** and tap **Continue.**

![select different apple id to reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-10.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Follow the in-app guide to reset your Apple ID password.

You can also designate a friend or family member you trust as your account recovery contact. They can help you reset your password if you forget it by providing a recovery code upon request.

Still Can't Change Your Apple ID Password? Try Account Recovery

The previous section showed you **how to change your Apple ID password** on any device if you cannot reset it. But what if you've tried all the steps in that section and you're still having trouble?

There's still one more option available: submit an account recovery request to Apple.

Account recovery is a process that can help you regain access to your Apple ID account if you don't have enough details to change your password or if you use two-factor authentication. The caveat? Account recovery can be lengthy and might take several days or longer. However, there are a few ways to expedite the recovery process:

- Confirm the six-digit code sent to your primary email address to prove that you're the account's rightful owner.
- Provide your credit card details. Apple will send an authorization request to your credit card issuer, which will help verify your identity.
