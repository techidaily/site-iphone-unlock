## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone 12 backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

If you forget your password, you will be required to reset it before being able to access your backups again.

### iCloud and iTunes Backup Password

Resetting your password may be done in different methods, depending on whether or not you have an iCloud account. You may reset your iCloud password by visiting the iCloud website and following the steps. This requires that you already have an iCloud account.

Connecting your device to a computer and using the iTunes program will allow you to reset your password even if you do not have an iCloud account. After successfully changing your password, you can access your backups the same way as before.

## Part 3: Tips for Successful Apple iPhone 12 Unlocking

Unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 can be a delicate process. To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:

### 1\. Check Device Eligibility

Make sure your Apple iPhone 12 is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.

### 2\. Backup Your Data

Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 12, [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.

If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.

### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 12's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.

Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 12 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn't been unlocked during this time.

When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 12 to the computer.

## Conclusion

To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 can be daunting when you've forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues.

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 12, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 12 device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 12, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 12.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 12 and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 12 and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 12 was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 12 in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 12 and unlock Apple iPhone 12.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 12

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 12, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 12:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 12 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 12 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 12/Apple iPhone 12 mini/Apple iPhone 12 Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 12 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 12 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 12 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 12 range builds on the Apple iPhone 12 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 12 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 12 lineup. the Apple iPhone 12 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 12 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 12 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 12 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 12 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 12 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 12 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 12 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 12 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 12. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 12 and unlocking it.
