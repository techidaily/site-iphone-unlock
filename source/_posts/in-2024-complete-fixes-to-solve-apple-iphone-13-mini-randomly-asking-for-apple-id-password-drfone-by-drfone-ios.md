### Way 3. Try Resetting Your Apple ID Password

Resetting your Apple ID password is a common solution for addressing problems linked to an inactive ID. This proves particularly effective when issues stem from entering incorrect login details.

#### Solution 1: Reset Apple ID Password From Settings

Do you know your Apple ID and simply need to reset the password? You can easily do so by following these steps within your Apple iPhone 13 mini's Settings:

#### Solution 2: Reset Apple ID Password From iForgot Website

Are you unable to reset your Apple ID password directly from your device? If you encounter issues using settings, another way to reset your Apple ID password exists. To initiate the password reset process, utilize the iForgot website. Follow these steps for **Apple ID, not active solution** using the iForgot website:

### Way 4. Check the iCloud Status Page

Verifying the status of Apple's services, including iCloud, can help determine if there's an ongoing outage. The Apple Status page provides real-time information about Apple's service. It displays disruptions, maintenance, or outages that might impact a service's availability. Follow these steps to check the iCloud Status page:

**Instructions.** Using a web browser on your computer or smartphone, go to the [System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) page provided by Apple. Check the status for services such as “Apple ID,” “iCloud Accounts & Sign In,” and other services. The fault lies at Apple's end if the indicators in front of these services are another color than green.
