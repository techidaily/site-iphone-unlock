It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only. Simply put, when your Apple iPhone 12 mini is locked for more than an hour, it needs to be unlocked to allow the connection of USB accessories. Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers.
