### C. Setting Up Security Questions

### D. Finalizing the Process

To finalize the creation process, refer to the steps given below:

- **Step 7:** Read through Apple's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. Once you've understood them, tick the box to confirm that you've read and agree to the iCloud and Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. Then click **Agree** to proceed.
