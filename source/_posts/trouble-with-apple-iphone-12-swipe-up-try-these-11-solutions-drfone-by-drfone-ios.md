## Part 2: How to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 passcode with Siri? (iOS 8.0 – iOS 10.1)

If you are an avid user of Apple products, then the chances are that you must have already heard of this Apple iPhone 12 hack. If you are running a device on iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1, then you can take the assistance of Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 lock.

You can follow these steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 passcode with Siri.

**Step 1**. Firstly, hold the Home button on our phone to activate Siri. Speak a command like “Siri, what time is it?” to ask the present time. Now, tap on the clock icon.
