Locked smartphones often come with binding carrier contracts. These can extend for two years or more. With an unlocked iPhone 15, you can avoid lengthy contracts. It puts you in control of your financial commitments and enables you to change your plan as you see fit.

### 4\. Resale Value

Unlocked iPhones have a higher resale value than their locked counterparts. The broader appeal and flexibility of an unlocked device make it an attractive option. It is true for most potential buyers in the second-hand market.

## Part 3: What Are the Drawbacks of Buying an Unlocked iPhone 15?

Unlocked iPhone 15 Series presents a world of advantages. However, it's essential to approach any decision with a balanced perspective. Given below are the potential drawbacks associated with purchasing an **iPhone 15 Pro unlocked**:

### 1\. Higher Upfront Cost

Unlocked iPhones often come with a higher upfront cost compared to locked devices. This is because carriers subsidize locked phones to some extent. Moreover, it allows them to offer lower initial prices in exchange for long-term contracts.

### 2\. Limited Trade-In Options

Some carriers offer trade-in programs for older phones when you upgrade to a new device. These programs might be more limited for unlocked devices. This can potentially affect your ability to offset the cost of a new phone.
