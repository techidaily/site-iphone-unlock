### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 8 Plus in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 8 Plus transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 8 Plus cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

**Step 3.** Tap the recently added reminder to open the "Reminders" application.

**Step 4.** Click the "Home" button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.

![use siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg)

As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.

## Apple iPhone 8 Plus Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking? Here's the Fix

## Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?

When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!

In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.

![encrypt local backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg)

Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup unlocking never set by you.

But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let's talk about them.

## Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password

Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.

One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.

There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

### 1\. Try all passwords you use on iPhone

When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?

To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.

A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.

Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.

### 2\. Find the password from Keychain on macOS

You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.

The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.

1. On your macOS, go to **Utilities** by clicking the **Applications** menu item. At this point, launch the **Keychain Access app** and look for your Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup.
2. To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.
3. On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg)

### 3\. "Reset All Settings"

Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.

Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:

**Step 1:** Unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, and then open the **Settings** app on your device.

**Step 2:** After locating the **General** menu, go to the **Reset** menu and then hit the **Reset All Settings** button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.

**Step 4:** The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 8 Plus using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.

You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.

**Step 1:** Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus using iCloud.

**Step 2:** After you have opened the **Settings** app, go to the **General** menu, then to the **Reset** menu, and finally to the **Erase All Content and Settings** option.

![reset in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg)

**Step 3:** Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to factory settings, and wait until it is done.

**Step 4:** Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the **Apps & Data** option.

**Step 5:** Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.

You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.

On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.

### 4\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

**First step:** After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled **"Screen Unlock."**

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the **"Remove Now"** button:

- Check to ensure that **"Find My iPhone"** is not turned on.
- During this procedure, you should not launch **"iTunes."**
- During the process, your Apple iPhone 8 Plus will restart.
