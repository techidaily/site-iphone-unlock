## 5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus in Lost Mode

Numerous security features make all Mac devices like iPhones, iPads, and Macs stand apart from the opposition in terms of user data safety. Lost Mode is one feature that locks your lost iPhone or other Apple devices so nobody can get to them.

If your device is gone, you can use the Find My application on your other Apple device connected to a similar account to **unlock the lost iPhone.**

If your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is in Lost Mode and you don't have the foggiest idea of how to restore it, relax. This guide will cover every one of the techniques that you can use for **iPhone Lost Mode unlock**.

## Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?

The Apple iPhone 15 Plus Lock feature permits remotely locking a lost Apple iPhone 15 Plus to prevent people from using its data. If you set a password for a device before enabling the Lost Mode, you will need this password to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus once it has returned to its proprietor.

The Lost Mode menu will ask you to set one if it has no password. Password is obligatory to stop Lost Mode once a device is returned to the owner, as Contact ID or Face ID won't work for this reason.

**Send a Custom Text Message:** When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.

**Erase Data Remotely:** Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 15 Plus if you believe it's been some time since it's gone and you don't think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.

**Track Your Device on Map:** An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

### 1\. Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode

The most straightforward method for unlocking the Apple iPhone 15 Plus in Lost Mode is entering the password on the actual device. If your device was protected with a password before placing it in Lost Mode, enter it again.

If your device had no password while placing it in Lost Mode and you've entered it into iCloud while placing your Apple iPhone 15 Plus into Lost Mode, utilize this password. That will help you **unlock lost iPhone**, and you can start operating your Apple iPhone 15 Plus again.

### 3\. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone's information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has an activation lock enabled.

The DNS bypass will send a fake "device isn't locked" message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to **unlock lost iPhone**:

- Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.
- A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the "I" icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap "Forget this Network."

- Tap on "Configure DNS," and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:

USA: 104.154.51.7

Asia: 104.155.28.90

Europe: 104.155.28.90

South America: 35.199.88.219

Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23

- Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network. Click the Back button when a popup says that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is attempting to connect to the Apple servers.
- You will now be on the DNS bypass screen. Pick the applications from the list to keep using your device. However, only a handful of applications are available through this.

### 4\. Use Emergency Call

This technique is the most widely recognized one. You can bypass your iCloud activation by settling on a fake Emergency call. Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won't work for everyone.

If your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your **iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:**

- Click the "Emergency Call" option on your locked device.

### II.IV: Unlock Disabled iPhone Without A Computer (Find My App)

Not so long ago, a computer was a necessity in every household for various reasons. Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and iPad.

The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users' requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.

So, in today's time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?

Worry not, because Apple's Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.

**Step 1:** Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled In Future

By now, you know that should the Apple iPhone 15 Plus be disabled for any reason, unlocking the disabled iPhone is a process that will wipe the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device clean. And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?

A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.

If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.

### Conclusion

It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.

But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone? The ways outlined in this guide will help you unlock your disabled iPhone.
