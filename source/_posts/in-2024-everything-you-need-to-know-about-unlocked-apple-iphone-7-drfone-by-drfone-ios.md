This feature allows you to maintain connectivity without constraints. This makes it an ideal companion for international adventurers.

## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone 7 backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

### Basic Ways for Password Security
