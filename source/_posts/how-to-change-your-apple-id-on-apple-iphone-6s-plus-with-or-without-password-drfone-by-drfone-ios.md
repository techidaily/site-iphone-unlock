## Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID

Your iOS devices contain most of your digital data. That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.

If you feel the existing Apple ID isn't secure enough, it's a good idea to **change your Apple ID on your iPad** or other devices. Aside from this, there are a few scenarios where you might find yourself needing to change your details:

Life moves fast, and sometimes contact info changes. If the email or phone number linked to your Apple ID becomes outdated, it's a good idea to update it. That way, you won't miss out on vital notifications or have trouble recovering your account if needed.

You Want To Simplify Your Online Life

If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.

You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country

Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.

## Part 4: How to get into a locked Apple iPhone 6s Plus with Siri?

If you don’t want to erase your device’s data while resolving this issue, you can use Siri. You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone 6s Plus by implementing the following steps:

**Step 1.** To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.

![hey siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491422339.jpg "hey siri")

**Step 2.** On the world clock interface, add another clock.

![world clock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491682149.jpg "world clock")

**Step 3.** The interface will ask you to search for a location of your choice. Type anything on the search tab and select it to get various options. Tap on the “Select all” text.

![select all](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491845337.jpg "select all")

**Step 4.** A few added options will be displayed. Tap on “Share” to proceed.

**Step 5.** Out of all the options to share this text, select the Message app.

![share on message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492171595.jpg "share on message")

**Step 6.** A new interface will be opened from where you can draft a new message. Type anything in the “To” field and tap "return" from a keyboard.

![send to](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492327446.jpg "send to")

**Step 7.** Then the text will be highlighted. Tap on the add icon.

![add contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492469564.jpg "add contact")

**Step 8.** This will open another interface to add a new contact. From here, tap on the “Create new contact” option.

![create new contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492596641.jpg "create new contact")

**Step 9.** Instead of adding a contact, tap on the photo icon and select the “Choose Photo” option.

![choose photo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492748614.jpg "choose photo")

**Step 10.** This will open the photo library on your phone. Visit an album or wait for a while.

![iphone photo library](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994493122244.jpg "iphone photo library")

**Step 11.** Now, press the home button. If nothing goes wrong, then you will enter the Home screen on your phone.
