### II.II: Unlock Disabled iPhone With iTunes/ macOS Finder

The above was a fast, intuitive, step-by-step way to get you through the unlock disabled iPhone process. This was an aftermarket app to help you through the process. However, if you want to achieve the same result the Apple way, do the following:

**Step 1:** Connect the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the computer with the cable and launch iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina and above).

**Step 2:** Press the volume up key on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and release. Then, press the volume down key and release. Lastly, press and hold the power key till you see Recovery Mode in Finder or iTunes.

**Step 3:** Click Restore to unlock disabled iPhone.

After this process, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is reset to factory defaults, and you will need to go through the setup process again.

You may also use Find My on the iCloud website to unlock your disabled iPhone, if the Find My network was enabled on the iPhone.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://icloud.com> and log in using the iCloud/ Apple ID that the disabled iPhone is using. This is important because if you use any other ID, you will see devices attached to that ID, not the disabled iPhone you want to unlock.

**Step 2:** Click Find My and select your disabled iPhone.

![icloud find my](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-3.jpg)

The Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max will be erased and restored to factory default settings. After that, you will have to set up the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max again.

### II.IV: Unlock Disabled iPhone Without A Computer (Find My App)

Not so long ago, a computer was a necessity in every household for various reasons. Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPad.

The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users' requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.

So, in today's time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?

Worry not, because Apple's Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.

**Step 1:** Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).

![unlock disabled iphone with find my app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.

Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled In Future

By now, you know that should the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max be disabled for any reason, unlocking the disabled iPhone is a process that will wipe the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device clean. And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?

A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.

If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.

### Conclusion

It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.

But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone? The ways outlined in this guide will help you unlock your disabled iPhone.
