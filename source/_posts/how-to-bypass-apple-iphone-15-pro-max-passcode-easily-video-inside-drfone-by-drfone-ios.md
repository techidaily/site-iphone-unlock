### Method 2: Using iTunes To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

An alternative method to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max when locked or disabled involves using iTunes. Note that if your iTunes is not synchronized with the iPhone, you risk losing your existing data. Here's how:

- **Step 1**: Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your locked iPhone using a cable and let iTunes identify the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Next, navigate to the **Summary** section and select the **Restore iPhone** option.

![itunes main window](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-10.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Allow iTunes to identify your device. Start the restoration of previous data by selecting **Restore Backup**. Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will be unlocked with all the associated data if you have backed up your information on iTunes. Otherwise, you will need to set it up as a new iPhone.

### Method 3: Using Recovery Mode To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

Activating Recovery mode is another useful method for accessing a locked phone. The approach erases all data on the phone, restoring it to factory settings. Any data not backed up will be lost using this method. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with a USB cable.
- **Step 2**: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button. If executed, the iTunes connect screen will appear. For earlier iPhone models, you can refer to [<u>here</u>](https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/iphone/iph8903c3ee6/15.0).

![iphone hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-11.jpg)

- **Step 3:** iTunes will prompt you to either restore or update your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Choose the **Restore iPhone** option to reset your device to its factory settings. If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max exits recovery mode, you'll need to repeat the steps.

### Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone

After **many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max**，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.

![icloud all devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Select **All Devices**, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu. Once you've chosen the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, click the **Erase iPhone** icon in the lower-right corner. Although the action deletes the data on the phone, you can retrieve it from your iCloud backup once the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is operational again.

### Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store

If all methods fail or you don't have access to Dr.Fone, consider contacting Apple Support. You can also try visiting an Apple Store. Apple experts will guide you through the appropriate steps based on your unique situation.
