Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation.

That is because the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.
