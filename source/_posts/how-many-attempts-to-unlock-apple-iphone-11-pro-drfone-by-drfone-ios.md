## Part 1. How Many Times Until the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Is Permanently Disabled?

Two things can happen on the tenth failed attempt to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. If you have **Erase Data** enabled, your phone's data gets wiped. If it's disabled, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro is permanently locked, requiring a connection to iTunes for restoration. It's crucial to [<u>back up your data on iCloud</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html) or locally to avoid permanent loss.

## Part 2. What Are the Consequences After Consecutive Failed Attempts?

It can initiate a data wipe or lock the iPhone, needing a connection to iTunes for restoration. After a series of failed attempts, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro can activate a security measure often referred to as a "self-destruct" mode.

To turn this mode on or off, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode** or **Touch ID & Passcode**, depending on your device. Enter your current passcode.

## Part 3. Set Up the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device Again Using the Security Lockout Procedure

Security Lockout or “iPhone Unavailable” happens when you attempt a wrong passcode 10 times. From there, you need to erase all your Apple iPhone 11 Pro data to regain access to the iOS device again.

While there is no direct way to regain access to your device when its passcode changes, you will have to [perform a factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to make it reusable. For that, look through the comprehensive guide on how to take your device out of this state:

- **Step 1.** After getting your iOS 17 device into the "iPhone Unavailable" stage, tap the "Forgot Passcode?" option in the bottom right corner.
- **Step 2.** To start the Apple iPhone 11 Pro reset, you need to tap on the “Start iPhone Reset.” Then, enter your Apple ID password in the given box and sign out your Apple ID. If you have an eSIM, you will be prompted with an option. Select the "Keep eSIM and Erase Data" or the "Delete eSIM and Erase Data" option according to your choice.

![use security unlock option to unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-6.jpg)

In another case, Apple allows you to temporarily sign in to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro using a recently changed passcode within 72 hours. But once you get into your device, set a new passcode immediately to retain your full access.

## Part 4. Using iTunes To Set Up iOS Device Again

iTunes service allows you to reset your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to factory settings and unlock the screen lock if **the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode changes on its own**. Using iTunes to set up your Apple iPhone 11 Pro again is a good and safe method, but it removes your device data. If you can compromise losing data, you can follow these instructions to remove the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Passcode Changed Itself issue using iTunes:

**Instructions.** Firstly, launch iTunes on your desktop and connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Then, you need to progress into putting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro in the [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263?at=1l3vrSk&ct=3e7454cbe7984ec49e91a8ace8e4198f). Continuing this, iTunes detects your device in Recovery Mode and shows two options: "Update" or "Restore." Click on the "Restore" option and hit the "OK" button to restore your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and regain access.

![restore ios device from itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-7.jpg)

## Part 5. Using iCloud To Set Up iOS Device Again

Using iCloud to unlock iOS devices is a safe and recommended method, but it also leads to complete data loss. If you wish to consider using the iCloud method, it is important for the Find My service to be active on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device. Also, you need to be aware of your Apple ID and password before proceeding. Follow this comprehensive guide step-by-step to set up your iOS device again using iCloud.

- **Step 1.** First of all, open iCloud on your desktop web browser. Afterward, enter your “Apple ID” and “Password” to proceed. After trusting the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, look for the "Grid" icon on the top right to find the "Find My" option in the list.

![access find my service from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-8.jpg)

- **Step 2.** After that, choose the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device that you want to recover. Then, click the "Erase This Device" option to remove data and regain your device access.

![erase ios device from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-9.jpg)

## Part 6. Using Find My App To Set Up iOS Device Again

This method needs you to have another iOS device signed into the same Apple ID with the Find My option enabled. After fulfilling these preconditions, you can follow these steps to set up your device whose **iPhone passcode changed from 4 to 6 digits by itself:**

- **Step 1.** Launch the Find My App on any other device, select the "Devices" tab from the bottom menu, find your locked iPhone in the list, and tap on that.
- **Step 2.** You must select the “Erase This Device” button to remove it from the iCloud account. This will instantly factory reset the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device as if it is a new iOS device.
