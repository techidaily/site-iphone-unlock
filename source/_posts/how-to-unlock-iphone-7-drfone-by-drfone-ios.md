## Part 2: How to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 passcode with Siri? (iOS 8.0 – iOS 10.1)

If you are an avid user of Apple products, then the chances are that you must have already heard of this Apple iPhone 7 hack. If you are running a device on iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1, then you can take the assistance of Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 lock. Even though this is not a secure way to surpass your phone’s lock screen, it doesn’t restore or erase your data in the process. You can follow these steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 passcode with Siri.

**Step 1**. Firstly, hold the Home button on our phone to activate Siri. Speak a command like “Siri, what time is it?” to ask the present time. Now, tap on the clock icon.

**Step 2.** It will open an interface for the world clock feature. From here, add another clock.

## Part 3: How to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 passcode with iTunes?

Another popular way to restore your Apple iPhone 7 is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Needless to say, even though you would be able to bypass the Apple iPhone 7 passcode, the technique will wipe the data on your device. Though, if you have already taken a backup of your data, then you can choose to restore it after performing an Apple iPhone 7 bypass. Do it by following these instructions.

**Step 1.** Launch iTunes on your system and connect it with a USB/lightning cable.

**Step 2.** Hold the Home button on your Apple iPhone 7 and while pressing it, connect it to your system. This will display a connect-to-iTunes symbol.

![connect to itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14993663711652.jpg "connect to itunes")

**Step 3.** After connecting your phone to the system, iTunes will automatically recognize it and display the following message. Simply click on the “Restore” button.
