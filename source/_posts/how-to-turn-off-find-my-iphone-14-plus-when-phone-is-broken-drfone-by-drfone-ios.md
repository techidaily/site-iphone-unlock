## Part 5. Directly Contact Administration for Removing Device Supervision

If you’ve forgotten the username and password of your management profiles, you cannot remove MDM profiles from iPhone settings. In that situation, you can only seek help from the company admin, as **this iPhone is supervised and managed by** them.

You can contact the administrator and share a valid reason why you want to remove supervision access. They can remove your device directly from their system or provide you with the correct password to proceed with the login process.
