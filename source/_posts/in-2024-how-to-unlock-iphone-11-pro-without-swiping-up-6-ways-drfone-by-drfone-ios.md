## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.
