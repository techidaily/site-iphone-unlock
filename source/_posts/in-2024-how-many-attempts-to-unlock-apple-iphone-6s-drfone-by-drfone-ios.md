## Bonus. How To Turn Restricted Mode On or Off on YouTube

YouTube's Restricted Mode on iPhone is valuable for users seeking a more controlled and family-friendly viewing experience. It serves to screen out mature content and ensures a safer environment, especially for younger audiences. Here's a breakdown of what YouTube's Restricted Mode does:

**Screens Out Mature Content**

Restricted Mode filters content that may not be suitable for all audiences, blocking videos with explicit or sensitive material.

**Comment Viewing Restrictions**

With Restricted Mode enabled, users cannot view comments on videos, offering an additional layer of protection and privacy.

**Browser and Device Level Functionality**

YouTube's Restricted Mode operates on both the browser and device levels. Once activated, it applies across various platforms, ensuring consistent content filtering.

**Different from Age-Restricting Videos**

It's important to note that Restricted Mode differs from age-restricting videos. While age restriction applies to specific videos, Restricted Mode filters content across the entire platform, providing a broader safety net.
