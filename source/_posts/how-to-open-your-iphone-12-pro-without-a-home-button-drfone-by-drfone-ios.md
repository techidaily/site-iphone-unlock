### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 Pro passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 12 Pro in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 Pro passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.
