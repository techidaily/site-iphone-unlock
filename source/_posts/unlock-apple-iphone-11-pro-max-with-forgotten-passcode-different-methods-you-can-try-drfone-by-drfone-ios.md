So let's get started.

## Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode

Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we'll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.

### 1\. Use Find My iPhone

![find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Select "All Devices" at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max from the list of devices.
- **Step 3:** Click "Erase iPhone" and confirm that you want to erase your device.

Once your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you've synced your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.

![with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg)

Just go with the steps below.

- **Step 1:** To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to a computer and turn on iTunes.
- **Step 2:** While your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.
- **Step 3:** When the "Restore" or "Update" appears, please choose "Restore".

iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it's finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.

### 3\. Use Siri

If you're running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn't work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it's not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.

- **Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"
