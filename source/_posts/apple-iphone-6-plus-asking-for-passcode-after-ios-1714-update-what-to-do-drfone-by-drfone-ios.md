## Apple iPhone 6 Plus Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 6 Plus displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2.** Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.

![android ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3.** You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4.** Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17/14.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5.** Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!

![ drfone advanced unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png)

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.

It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg)

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

![find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg)

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary

And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17/14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!



## Unlocking Apple iPhone 6 Plus  Lock Screen: 3 Foolproof Methods that Actually Work

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.

Looking more into the Apple iPhone 6 Plus world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 6 Plus . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.

## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 6 Plus  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 6 Plus  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

Best Practices To Secure Your iOS Data

**Changing your Apple ID on your iPad** can be a great way to protect your privacy and security. However, it's important to take steps to ensure that your iOS data remains safe during the process. Here are some tips to help you do just that:

- **Backup Your Files**

Before you **change your Apple ID on your iPad**, create a [<u>backup of your data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup/backup-iphone-with-broken-screen.html) so you don't lose important files. You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.

Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you're getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.

- **Password Check**

Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.

- **Avoid Sharing an Apple ID**

It's best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It's simple and highly effective.

## Conclusion

**Changing your Apple ID on your iPad** or other iOS devices is a simple process that can help you protect your privacy and information. With the tips above, you can ensure your iOS data is safe and secure during the switch.

And if you need to remove your Apple ID without a password, Dr.Fone is a good option. Dr.Fone is a powerful iOS toolkit that can help you with various phone solutions. It's easy to use and can help you solve mobile problems in just a few minutes.
