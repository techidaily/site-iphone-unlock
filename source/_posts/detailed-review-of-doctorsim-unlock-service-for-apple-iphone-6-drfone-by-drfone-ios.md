### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the Find My iPhone function, then you can try it to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![use find My Apple iPhone 6 to unlock iphone 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 5:** Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.

**Step 6:** Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 6:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 6:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.
