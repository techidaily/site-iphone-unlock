Before bypassing the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen guidelines. The Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. However, if you can't activate the Recovery mode, you can figure out how to activate the DFU mode from their official site.

**Step 3. Affirm Device Information**

After getting the phone in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max model and other data. You can choose the right information from the dropdown menu if the information isn't right. Then, at that point, download the firmware for your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.

**Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Screen Lock**

After downloading the required firmware effectively, click Unlock Now to remove the lock. However, note that this unlocking system will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Truly, there is no answer for **iPhone Lost Mode unlock** without losing your data.

### The Bottom Line

You might forget the password used before placing your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max in Lost Mode. It is also likely to purchase a locked device, and then you can't contact the owner to unlock it and don't know your Apple ID details. Some might think this is a dead situation, and you can't use the iPhone.

Luckily, we’re here to provide a series of dependable and secure solutions that will help your **iPhone in Lost Mode unlock.**
