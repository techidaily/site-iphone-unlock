### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 6 passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 6 in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 6 device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 6 passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 6, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 6 and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

If the Apple iPhone 6 device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 6 cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri
