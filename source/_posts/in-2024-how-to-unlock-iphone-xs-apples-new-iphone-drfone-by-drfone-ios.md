## How to Unlock Apple iPhone XS, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone XS with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone XS is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone XS Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone XS is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone XS from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone XS, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone XS and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone XS does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

## Part 7: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Third-Party Apps?

### 1\. Lock Apps onApple iPhone XS & iPad via Famisafe

If the reason you want to lock the apps on your Apple iPhone XS has to do with managing your kid's phone usage, we have an excellent alternative for you. [FamiSafe](https://famisafe.wondershare.com/) is a reliable parental control app that offers features to monitor and manage a child's device usage. It focuses on parental controls, including features like screen time management, location tracking, web filtering, and activity monitoring.

It offers robust controls to restrict overall device usage, set screen time limits, and monitor app usage. This helps parents guide and regulate their children's activities on iOS devices. You can use the following steps to lock apps using FamiSafe:

**Step 1: Install FamiSafe and FamiSafe Jr on Respective Devices**

Get FamiSafe from the App Store and log in using your Wondershare ID or your Apple, Google, or Facebook account. Select the parent mode and link your child's phone by installing FamiSafe Jr on their devices using either the QR code or the pairing code. Once the pairing is done, input details about your children and allow FamiSafe Jr to oversee their devices.

![download the famisafe apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-9.jpg)

**Step 2: Provide the Necessary Permissions to FamiSafe**

Now, activate Accessibility for FamiSafe by accessing "Settings," tapping "FamiSafe," and enabling "Location." Then, grant access to the Apple iPhone XS device's photos, microphone, and motion & fitness activity. Now, use a computer and connect your child's device with a USB cable. Activate content blockers in Safari to prevent kids from accessing inappropriate content.

![enable the content blockers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-10.jpg)

**Step 3: Connect the Kid's Device to the Computer**

To do that, access "Safari" in "Settings" and move to"Content Blockers" to enable FamiSafe. To get started, connect your kids' iOS devices to your PC. Once connected, navigate to the main interface and select "Features" located at the bottom. This will display available features, and you can proceed by tapping on "App Blocker."

![select the app blocker feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-11.jpg)

**Step 4: Block Any App Using the App Blocker Feature**

Establish the connection between your kids' iOS devices and your PC by pairing them with your phone. From there, effortlessly choose and block any unwanted apps on your kids' phones. Additionally, you have the option to block apps based on their App Store ratings for added control and security.

### 2\. Lock apps onApple iPhone XS & iPad using App Locker

Besides the native iPhone app lock solutions, you can also take the assistance of a third-party tool. However, most of these apps only support jailbroken devices. Therefore, if you wish to use a dedicated app lock for your Apple iPhone XS, then you need to jailbreak your device. Needless to say, getting your device jailbroken has its perks and demerits. If you don’t want to jailbreak your device, then you can simply take the assistance of the above-mentioned solutions.

However, if you have a jailbroken device and would like to app lock the iPhone, then you can also use AppLocker. It is available at Cydia’s repository and can be purchased for just $0.99. It can be installed on your jailbroken device to get an added level of security. Not just apps, it can also be used to lock certain settings, folders, accessibilities, and more. To learn how to lock apps on iPhone using AppLocker, follow these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, get AppLocker on your device from <http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker>. As of now, it works on iOS 6 to 10 versions.

**Step 2.** After installing the tweak, you can go to Settings > Applocker to access it.

![iphone applocker](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136509845.jpg)

**Step 3.** To access the feature, make sure that you have “**Enabled**” it (by turning it on).

**Step 4.** This will let you set up a passcode to lock the apps and settings of your choice.

**Step 5.** To app lock, the iPhone, visit the “**Application Locking**” feature on your device.

![application locking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136826933.jpg)

**Step 6.** From here, you can turn on (or off) the locking feature for apps of your choice.

This will let your app lock the Apple iPhone XS without any trouble. You can also go to the “Reset Password Phrase” to change the passcode.

### 3\. Lock Apps onApple iPhone XS & iPad using BioProtect

Just like Applocker, BioProtect is another third-party tool that works only on jailbroken devices. It can also be downloaded from Cydia’s repository. Apart from apps, you can also use BioProtect to lock settings, SIM features, folders, and more. It is linked to the Touch ID of the Apple iPhone XS device and scans the fingerprint of a user to grant (or deny) access to any app. The app only works on iPhone 5s and later devices, having a Touch ID. However, you can also set a passcode as well if your Touch ID is not working. To use the BioProtect app lock for iPhone, follow these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, get the BioProtect app to lock iPhone on your device from the right <http://cydia.saurik.com/package/net.limneos.bioprotect/>.

**Step 2.** To access the tweak’s panel, you need to provide your fingerprint access.

**Step 3.** Place your finger on your Touch ID and match its print.

![app is locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137022586.jpg)

**Step 4.** This will let you access the BioProtect app settings.

**Step 5.** Firstly, enable the app by turning the respective feature on.

**Step 6.** Under the “**Protected Applications**” section, you can see a list of all the major apps.

![protected applications](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137256044.jpg)

**Step 7.** Simply turn on (or off) the feature of the app that you wish to lock.

**Step 8.** You can also go to the “Touch ID” feature to further calibrate the app.

**Step 9.** After setting the lock, you would be asked to authenticate using your fingerprint to access the protected app.
