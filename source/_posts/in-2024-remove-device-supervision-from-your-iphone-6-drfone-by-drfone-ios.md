- **Step 5:** Because this technique requires you to jailbreak your iOS device, you will be prompted to do so first. Click on **Jailbreak Guide** if you wish to follow a guide. If you want to follow a video guide instead, click on **Watch Video**.
- **Step 6:** After that, the screen will prompt you to conduct a series of actions, beginning with removing the SIM card from the iDevice. Continue to **Settings,** then **WLAN**, to access the Apple iPhone 6 device's network settings. Locate the Wi-Fi networks you have joined and select **Forget This Network**. Remove all linked networks from **My Networks** and disable Wi-Fi. After that, re-insert your SIM card and tap **Continue**.
