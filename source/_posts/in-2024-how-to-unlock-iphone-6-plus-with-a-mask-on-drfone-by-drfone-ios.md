## Forgot Apple iPhone 6 Plus Backup Password? Here's What to Do

Forgetting your Apple iPhone 6 Plus backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can't access your data, but it also means you can't restore your phone if something goes wrong.

There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 6 Plus backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you're having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 6 Plus backup password, don't despair. There are still ways to get it back!

![forget backup password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 6 Plus is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password

### 1\. Try all passwords you used on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus

The typical method that each individual attempts for the first time is to input all of the available passcodes. Even if it is the most straightforward technique, there is still a possibility that you miss one of them. Therefore, think about all of the passwords you may input, which are listed below.

- The password to log in to the computer
- The password to access Apple ID
- The password to access the encrypted data on the hard disk
- The password to access various websites
- The password to log in to the computer
- Password for the wireless network
- Password for the email account
- Passcode for the administrator
- Passcode for the iPhone

### 2\. "Reset All Settings" via "Settings"

To begin, go to the **Settings** app on your iOS device, then choose **General**, followed by **Reset.**

![reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-3.jpg)

You may now go to **Reset All Settings** and confirm by entering the security passcode when prompted. Then, your phone will automatically go through the process of resetting and returning to its default settings.

You can also get rid of the password for the last backup without deleting any other apps or data.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-4.jpg)

Use a USB cable to link your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your PC. Look at the small iOS icon in the figure below. Just click on it.

![backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-5.jpg)

Proceed to the **Summary Page** and make your selection there for **The Computer.** After selecting **Encrypt Local Backup**, you must create a new password. After you have pressed the **Backup Now** option, wait for iTunes to create a new password for you.

### 3\. Find your password in the macOS keychain

**Step 1:** Launch Keychain Access by going to **Application** \> **Utilities** \> **Keychain Access** once your Mac has booted up.

**Step 2:** Check for a backup of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus by entering it into the search box and looking for it there.

**Step 3:** Double-click the **Show Password** option, and then choose it from the drop-down menu. After that, type in the password for the keychain. At long last, the password for your Apple iPhone 6 Plus backup will be shown.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-6.jpg)

### 4\. Select "Back Up Now" via iCloud to remove password

If you already have a backup stored in iCloud, you may use iCloud for recovery.

First, power up the gadget and look for the "Hello" screen. If you have previously set up your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you must delete or remove all of the material before continuing.

Navigate to the **Apps & Data menu** and choose the **Restore from iCloud Backup** option.

After successfully signing in with your Apple ID, choose **Backup**.

![restore from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-7.jpg)

Before you click **Remove Now**, please carefully read the following three notes:

- Make sure to turn off **Find My iPhone**.
- Don't open iTunes while doing this.
- Your device will reboot

![connected](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone can check your iTunes backup and delete it by itself. This encryption will be erased when the progress bar reaches 100%. This will take a short time to do.

![checking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png)

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 6 Plus will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!
