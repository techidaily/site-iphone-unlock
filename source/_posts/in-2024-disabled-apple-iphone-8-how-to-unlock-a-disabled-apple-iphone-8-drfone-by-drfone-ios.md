_Apple iPhone 8 Disabled?_

Because of using face masks, [Face ID](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone-13.html) on iPhone does not always work correctly, and we are entering our passcodes more than before. If we enter it incorrectly a few times in succession, the phone will disable itself to prevent unauthorized access. It can seem like the end of the world because in so many ways smartphones have become our world. Here are ways you can unlock your Apple iPhone 8 disabled due to too many incorrect passcode attempts.

## Part 1: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Without iTunes/ iCloud Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)

Do note that all methods that unlock your Apple iPhone 8 will necessarily wipe your Apple iPhone 8 and remove all data from the Apple iPhone 8 device, essentially booting it up as new.

**Step 1:** Launch Dr.Fone and click the module titled "Screen Unlock".

**Step 2:** Choose the "iOS" option, then select "Unlock iOS Screen" on the subsequent screen to continue unlocking your Apple iPhone 8.

![screen unlock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-1.png)

**Step 3:** Follow the provided instructions to start the disabled Apple iPhone 8 in Recovery Mode to unlock it. If for any reason the phone does not boot in Recovery Mode, there are instructions provided at the bottom to enter what is called DFU mode.

![device page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone will read and display your phone model and the software installed on it. If the model displayed is incorrect, use the dropdown to pick the correct detail. Click "Start" to download the specific firmware file for your particular Apple iPhone 8 model.

![download firmware](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5:** After the download completes, please click Unlock Now to start unlocking the disabled Apple iPhone 8.

![start unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

Your Apple iPhone 8 will be unlocked in a short span of time. Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the Apple iPhone 8 device. When you set the Apple iPhone 8 device up again, if you set it to use iCloud, data such as Contacts, iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive data, etc. will be downloaded onto your device again. The apps you had on your Apple iPhone 8 prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the Apple iPhone 8 device again.

## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 8 to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 8 and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 8) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![restore iphone to factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 8 and unlock your Apple iPhone 8.

When the Apple iPhone 8 reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)

Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn't require going through complex hoops.

Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 8, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 8.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 8.

![icloud find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 8 remotely and your Apple iPhone 8 will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 8 once again.

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 8.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 8 from the Apple iPhone 8 devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 8 and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 8 with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 and return the Apple iPhone 8 device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 8 is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 8 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 8 easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 8 again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 8, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 8 disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 8 device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 8

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 8 or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 8 or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In

Sometimes, simply [<u>signing out of your Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html) and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the **Settings** app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to **Sign Out**. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.

Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure. Regularly checking your Apple ID settings and payment information can prevent many common issues with the App Store, including the frustrating ‘Verification Required’ prompt.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 8 without Passcode
