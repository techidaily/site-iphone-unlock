This means that it might be easier for you if you have another Apple device signed in to the same iCloud as the locked iPhone, else you will need to temporarily sign out of the account on that device and sign in with the requisite account. It is cumbersome, but it is better than nothing in a pinch.

**Step 1:** Launch Find My app on your macOS or iOS device.

![unlock iphone with find my app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-4.jpg)

## Part II: FAQs

Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.

### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 13 device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 13 without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

![touch id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-5.jpg)

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 13 is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 13 device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

### Unlock it with iTunes

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.

**Step 2:** Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.

**Step 3:** Once recognized, your Apple iPhone 13 will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 13:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the computer and launch the iTunes application.

**Step 2:** Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

**Step 3:** As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.

**Step 4:** On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.

### Contact the owner with the phone number in lost mode

Many iPhone owners habitually put their phone numbers in lost mode. So, you can check if any phone number is available in the lost mode. If a phone number is available, you can contact the owner and return the Apple iPhone 13 to them.

The rightful owner of the Apple iPhone 13 activates lost mode. You can see the lost mode on the notification panel, where a message will show that the phone is lost. The owner can also remotely lock the phone using this mode.

### Check medical ID in an emergency call

There is a feature in the Apple iPhone 13 known as medical ID. This feature can help you contact the owner of the found iPhone if they are unavailable.

To do this, go to the emergency call screen and tap on the Medical ID option. Here, you can find out the name and phone number of the owner. So, you can use this information to contact the owner and return the iPhone.

### Take photos to communicate with the owner via iCloud

This is a great way to contact the owner of a lost iPhone. You can use this method if you cannot find the owner's phone number in the lost mode or medical ID.

To do this, go to Settings -> iCloud -> Photos and turn on the iCloud Photo Library. Now, take some pictures with the found iPhone, and they will be automatically uploaded to iCloud.

Most people who have lost their iPhones often check their iCloud, and once they find out that someone is taking pictures and uploading them to their iCloud, they will try to communicate with you.

And that's how you can also communicate with them and ask for contact details so that you can return their phone and be a good citizen.
