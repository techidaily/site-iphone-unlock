### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.
