One of the most reliable options is the Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit. Though, in order to use it, you need to download [its licensed version](https://www.elcomsoft.com/) from its website right.

Later, you can simply connect your phone to the system and run the forensic tool. From the welcome screen, select the option of “Get Passcode”. This will run an encrypted command and provide a passcode to your phone that can be used to unlock it.

### Wrap it up

After following these solutions, you would be able to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 lock without any trouble. You can simply choose your preferred option and perform an Apple iPhone 13 bypass. If you are not able to unlock your phone with Siri, then use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is an extremely safe option to help you bypass the Apple iPhone 13 passcode and overcome various iOS-related problems.
