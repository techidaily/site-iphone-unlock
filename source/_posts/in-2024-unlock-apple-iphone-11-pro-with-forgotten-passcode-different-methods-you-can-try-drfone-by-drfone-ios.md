## Unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro With Forgotten Passcode: Different Methods You Can Try

Have you forgotten the passcode iPhone 6? We know forgetting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode can be a frustrating experience, but luckily it is possible to unlock your device. Using different methods, we will show you how to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 6 with a forgotten passcode.

So let's get started.

## Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode

Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we'll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.

### 1\. Use Find My iPhone

If you've activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn't require any technical knowledge or special tools.

![find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg)

Just follow the steps below and get started.

- **Step 1:** Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com/find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.
- **Step 2:** Select "All Devices" at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 11 Pro from the list of devices.
- **Step 3:** Click "Erase iPhone" and confirm that you want to erase your device.

Once your Apple iPhone 11 Pro has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you've synced your Apple iPhone 11 Pro with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.

![with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg)

Just go with the steps below.

- **Step 1:** To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to a computer and turn on iTunes.
- **Step 2:** While your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.
- **Step 3:** When the "Restore" or "Update" appears, please choose "Restore".

iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it's finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.

### 3\. Use Siri

If you're running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn't work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it's not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.

![siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg)

Just follow the instructions.

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"
- **Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock".
- **Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

While this method doesn't give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device's features.

## Apple iPhone 11 Pro Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 11 Pro displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.

It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and use it without a lock screen!

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg)

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 11 Pro in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

![find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg)

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary
