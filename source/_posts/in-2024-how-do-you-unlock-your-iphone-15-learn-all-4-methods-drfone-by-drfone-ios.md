Two things can happen on the tenth failed attempt to unlock your Apple iPhone 15. If you have **Erase Data** enabled, your phone's data gets wiped. If it's disabled, the Apple iPhone 15 is permanently locked, requiring a connection to iTunes for restoration. It's crucial to [<u>back up your data on iCloud</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html) or locally to avoid permanent loss.

## Part 2. What Are the Consequences After Consecutive Failed Attempts?

When you exceed ten unsuccessful passcode entries, the Apple iPhone 15 device takes stringent actions to protect sensitive data. It can initiate a data wipe or lock the iPhone, needing a connection to iTunes for restoration. After a series of failed attempts, the Apple iPhone 15 can activate a security measure often referred to as a "self-destruct" mode.

To turn this mode on or off, follow these steps:

### How To Enable Erase Data Mode

Safeguard your personal information with these simple steps to remotely wipe your device in case of loss or theft.

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode** or **Touch ID & Passcode**, depending on your device. Enter your current passcode.

### Method 2: Using iTunes To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

An alternative method to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 when locked or disabled involves using iTunes. Note that if your iTunes is not synchronized with the iPhone, you risk losing your existing data. Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 15 with a USB cable.
- **Step 2**: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button.

### Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone

After **many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 15**，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.

- **Step 2:** Select **All Devices**, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu. Once you've chosen the Apple iPhone 15 device, click the **Erase iPhone** icon in the lower-right corner.
