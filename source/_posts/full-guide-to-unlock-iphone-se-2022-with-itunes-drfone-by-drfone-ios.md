## How to Unlock Apple iPhone SE (2022) With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesn't Work

![man wearing apple watch with Apple iPhone SE (2022) by him](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch.jpg)

There are plenty of reasons why Apple devices are in such high demand. The quality of the products is unquestionable â€“ few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone SE (2022)â€™s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.

However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.

With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone SE (2022)â€™s camera working as your Macâ€™s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.

Moreover, you might be able to **use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2022)**.

Now, you cannot just **unlock any Apple iPhone SE (2022) with your Watch**. The devices must be paired, and youâ€™ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Hereâ€™s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.


## Part 1. Can I Use an Apple Watch To Unlock My Apple iPhone SE (2022)?

![phone, earphones, and apple watch on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-2.jpg)

The Apple iPhone SE (2022) face ID is one of the simplest, most practical ways to unlock your phone. While youâ€™ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you wonâ€™t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.

With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.

The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes arenâ€™t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and canâ€™t take them off for some reason, face ID wonâ€™t work. If you have gloves on and canâ€™t type in your passcode, your passcodes wonâ€™t work.

What could work is your Apple Watch.

Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone SE (2022) model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. Itâ€™s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.

- Glance at your phone while wearing a face mask, sunglasses, or another item thatâ€™s preventing you from using Face ID;
- Swipe up on your phoneâ€™s screen.

Your Apple Watch will send an alert when youâ€™ve used it to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2022). If you accidentally unlock your phone, simply tap on the **Lock Apple iPhone SE (2022)**Â on the screen of your watch to lock it.

However, remember that the next time you want to use your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2022), youâ€™ll first need to type in your passcode.

## Part 4. What To Do if You Canâ€™t Unlock Your Apple iPhone SE (2022) With a Watch

![person wearing face mask unlocking their Apple iPhone SE (2022)](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-7.jpg)

Generally speaking, unlocking your Apple iPhone SE (2022) with an Apple Watch should be a simple, seamless task. Unfortunately, though, thatâ€™s not always the case. A glitch or a bug could be preventing you from enjoying this feature, so take a look at a few things you could try to fix it.

### 1.Â Check All Settings & Reconfigure

As mentioned earlier, there are a few requirements that your devices need to meet to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2022) with your Apple Watch.

If youâ€™re using the correct versions of Apple iPhone SE (2022) (iPhone X, iOS 14.5 and newer) and Apple Watch (series 3, watchOS 7.4 and newer), try to reconfigure your settings.

Make sure that you have:

- A passcode on your watch;
- Wrist detection turned on;
- Feature **Unlock with Apple Watch**turned on on your Apple iPhone SE (2022).

If all the settings are correct, try one of the following options.

### 2.Â Restart Your WiFi/Bluetooth Connection

Your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and your Apple Watch need to have both WiFi and Bluetooth turned on. If theyâ€™re turned on on both devices, try turning them off and back on again to restart the connection.

Remember, you only need WiFi and Bluetooth on but donâ€™t need to be connected to a WiFi network.

If the problem persists, you could also restart your devices and try again.

### 3.Â Reset Your Face ID

In some instances, itâ€™s the Face ID feature thatâ€™s causing trouble, so you might want to try and reset it. Itâ€™s much easier than it may sound, you just need to follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone SE (2022)â€™s **Settings**;
- **Step 2:** Select **Face ID & Passcode**;
- **Step 3:** Tap **Reset Face ID**.

When you tap on this, youâ€™ll need to go through the process of setting your Face ID as usual. Youâ€™ll need to type in your passcode, hold your Apple iPhone SE (2022) in front of you (in portrait orientation), tap to get started, and put your face in the provided frame.

Move your face to complete the circle, then tap on **Continue**. Repeat the face scan process the second time and select **Done**.

### 4.Â Do a System Repair on Your Apple iPhone SE (2022)

If your Apple Watch unlock is still misbehaving, you might need to do a full system repair. As a general rule of thumb, itâ€™s best to use verified apps like Dr.Fone to prevent the problem from getting worse.

[<u>Dr.Fone Apple iPhone SE (2022) system repair</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/ios-system-recovery.html)Â is designed to be fast, efficient, and safe. It can repair virtually any system glitch in less than five minutes, ensuring your phone operates seamlessly.

To perform a standard system repair with Dr.Fone, follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Download and launch Dr.Fone on your computer;
- **Step 2:** From the **Toolbox**on your left-hand side, select **System Repair**;

- **Step 3:** Connect your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to your PC using a cable connection;
- **Step 4:** Select your device type in the new window that opens;
- **Step 5:** Select **iOS repair**;

![dr.fone ios repair](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/ios-system-repair-1.png)

- **Step 6:** Select **Standard Repair Mode**;
- **Step 7:** Follow the on-screen instructions and select **Enter Recovery Mode**;
- (Alternatively, select **Guide**if your phone is unresponsive);
- **Step 8:** Select the iOS firmware you want to download and install on your device;
- **Step 9:** Wait for the download to finish, then select **Repair Now**;
- **Step 10:** Wait until the process is complete, then select **Done**.

If it was a system mistake preventing you from unlocking your Apple iPhone SE (2022) with your Apple Watch, the option should be functioning well after the Dr.Fone iOS repair.

### 5.Â Reset Network Settings

If the problem wasnâ€™t due to a system glitch, you should try resetting your Apple iPhone SE (2022)â€™s network settings. The process is simple, just:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network**;
- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode.

Resetting your network settings will clear out data from your internet, local network, and devices, including WiFi passwords, some Bluetooth connections, and more. However, your paired devices, such as the Apple Watch, shouldnâ€™t be removed.

### 6.Â Reset Your Watch and Pair It Again

Finally, if youâ€™re still experiencing issues, you might need to reset your Apple Watch and pair it with your Apple iPhone SE (2022) again.

Itâ€™s all quite simple:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button;
- **Step 2:** Drag the slider under **Power off**to the right;
- **Step 3:** Press and hold the power button to turn the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device back on.

To perform a hard reset, simultaneously press and hold the power button and digital crown.

## Conclusion

Using your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is convenient when you cannot use the Face ID feature. It allows you to seamlessly unlock your phone when wearing sunglasses, goggles, face masks, or other face coverings that prevent the Face ID from working.

Enabling this option is a straightforward process, and if thereâ€™s ever a glitch, there are several options you could try to repair it.
