**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

**Pros**

For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.

**Cons**
