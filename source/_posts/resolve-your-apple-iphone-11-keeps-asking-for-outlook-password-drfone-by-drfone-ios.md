## Part 1. Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking for Outlook Password

The **iPhone asking for Outlook password** arises from a combination of factors. Understanding these reasons is crucial in diagnosing and resolving the problem effectively:

### 1\. Incorrect Password Entry

Users might unknowingly enter the wrong password. They may have changed their Outlook password without updating it on their iPhones. This mismatch can trigger continuous password prompts.

An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone 11 may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone 11 keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

Upholding a stable internet connection is necessary for effortless communication. An unreliable or unstable network can disrupt the synchronization process in Outlook.

### 4\. Corrupted Email Account Profile

A corrupted email account profile on the Apple iPhone 11 can cause disruptions during the authentication process. Resetting the email account on the Apple iPhone 11 device might be necessary to resolve the issue.

### 5\. Third-Party App Interference

Other mail applications installed on the Apple iPhone 11 can also cause an issue. They might interfere with the Outlook app's proper functioning. Identifying and temporarily disabling such apps can help diagnose and resolve the issue.

### 6\. Excessive Email Fetching

Configuring the Outlook mail app to fetch emails too frequently causes the issue. It can strain the connection with Outlook servers, leading to authentication challenges. That causes issues like the Apple iPhone 11 asking for a password.

### 7\. iOS Software Glitches

The smooth functioning of the Mail app may be disrupted by problems and malfunctions present in the iOS software. Compatibility issues could emerge if your device is not operating on the latest iOS version.

It's a frustrating situation where you forgot your Apple iPhone 11's passcode and are now unable to unlock it. Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone 11, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode.

There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone's stock features like Find My Apple iPhone 11 or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 lock screen.

So, let's get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 lock screen.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 11 without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 11 passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

![using itunes to unlock iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg)

Follow the steps to do this.

1. First, connect your Apple iPhone 11 to your computer and launch iTunes. You will have to install it if you don't have it on your computer. For installation, [click here and download](https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes)
2. Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.
3. Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone 11's specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named **Restore iPhone**.
4. By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone 11, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 XR lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone

If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven't used iTunes before, we have another solution. You can use the "Find My iPhone" feature to erase your device and unlock it. This is useful when you quickly want to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode.

3. Once you find it, click on it, and you will see a few more options, and one of them would be **Erase iPhone**.
4. You will have to click on it, showing you a confirmation message to erase all your data on your Apple iPhone 11.
5. Confirm it, and your Apple iPhone 11 will be restored to the factory settings, and all your data will be removed.
6. Once the process is completed, you can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 X lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #3: Remove Passcode With Tapping Erase Phone (iOS 15.2 only)
