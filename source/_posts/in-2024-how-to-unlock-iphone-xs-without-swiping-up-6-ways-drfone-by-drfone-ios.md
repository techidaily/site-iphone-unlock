## Part 5. What To Do When iCloud Activation Lock Active?

Although IMEI Unlocking turns out to be quite an exceptional service, it generally is not the only thing that becomes a barrier for iPhone users. The iCloud Activation binds an Apple device to a user's Apple ID, making itself a great security measure. It presents a unique circumstance where services such as **doctorSIM legit** are inapplicable. [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) specializes in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock.

It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions. Once the activation lock is removed, it grants full access to users' devices. Dr.Fone also extends its capabilities to remove an Apple ID in cases where the password is forgotten. Its remarkable performance includes the permanent bypass of the Apple ID lock.

### Steps To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock via Wondershare Dr.Fone

Dr.Fone is intended for users locked out of their devices. Given below are the steps you need to follow when using Dr.Fone to bypass iCloud Activation Lock:

#### 1\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1

- **Step 1. Installation and iCloud Activation Lock Removal**

Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the "Toolbox" tab, navigate to "Screen Unlock" and select "iOS." In the following window, choose "iCloud Activation Lock Removal" and click "Start" to begin the process and receive a prompt to connect your iOS device.

- **Step 2. Device Identification and Unlock Initiation**

Now, decide whether your device is GSM or CDMA, as it is an important aspect. Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device won't affect the Apple iPhone XS device. However, running this process on a CDMA device will result in a loss of cellular activities. Click "Unlock Now" to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you'll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click "Got It!" after agreeing with all the mentioned points.

- **Step 3. Jailbreaking and Activation Lock Bypass**

After this, if your iDevice isn't jailbroken, you will be required to jailbreak your device. For that, you can follow the step-by-step textual instructions or watch a video. Once the Apple iPhone XS device is jailbroken, the process will commence automatically to bypass the Activation Lock. A completion message will pop up on the window when the process finishes. Afterward, tap the “Done” button to finalize the process successfully.

On accessing the “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” page, a notification will display on the screen, alerting the user about the ongoing process. Carefully review all the information provided and select the "I have read and agree to the agreement" option. Proceed by tapping on the "Got It!" choice.

- **Step 2. DFU Mode Initiation and Device Unlock**

Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the [DFU Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/dfu-mode/tools-for-iphone-to-enter-dfu-mode.html) for your iOS device. Once in the particular mode, the program will send an initial command to the Apple iPhone XS device, prompting it to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed and repeat putting the iOS device in DFU Mode. Likewise, upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone XS device promptly. Finally, click the "Got It!" button to conclude the process.

Once finished, a completion message will appear on the screen. Click “Done” to finalize the removal of the iCloud Activation Lock.
