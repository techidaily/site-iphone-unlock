## 5 Easy Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone SE without Passcode by Yourself

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the Find My iPhone function, then you can try it to unlock your Apple iPhone SE without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![use find My Apple iPhone SE to unlock iphone 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.

**Step 4:** Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone SE from the list of devices.

**Step 5:** Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.

**Step 6:** Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone SE without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone SE:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone SE to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.

**Step 2:** Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone SE:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone SE to the computer and launch the iTunes application.

**Step 2:** Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

**Step 3:** As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.

**Step 4:** On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone SE without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.

## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone SE

Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone SE device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone SE device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone SE device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone SE device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone SE device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone SE device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone SE device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone SE Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone SE locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone SE device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone SE device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone SE device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone SE:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone SE device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone SE:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

![select find my feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone SE from "All Devices." Now choose "Erase iPhone" from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone SE device and remove the Activation Lock.

![tap on erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg)

### Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone SE Locked to Owner

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone SE device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone SE to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.

The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone SE device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone SE Activation Lock:

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone SE is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone SE Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.
- ****Step 2:**** Select "More Wi-Fi Settings" using the "i" symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose "Configure DNS" and follow it by selecting the "Manual" option.
- ****Step 3:**** Afterward, press "Add Server," located under "DNS Servers." Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:

- For users in the United States/North America: 104.154.51.7
- For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90
- For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58
- For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60

![use the dns method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg)

- ****Step 4:**** Save the changes by selecting "Save." Use the back arrow button to go back and choose "Ask to Join Networks." Enter the network password and tap "Join." Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone SE attempts to activate. Afterward, continue to set up your Apple iPhone SE.

### Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service

What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn't working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone SE. All you need to provide them is your Apple iPhone SE IMEI number. The process is done remotely and takes 24 to 48 hours to complete.

Ensure your device IMEI is not blacklisted before sending it for the unlocking process. Described below are steps to use [<u>DirectUnlocks</u>](https://directunlocks.com/en_us/icloud-unlock), an iCloud Activation removal service:

- ****Step 1:**** Use your computer's browser to visit the official DriectUnlocks website. Enter your Apple iPhone SE's IMEI number and select the Apple iPhone SE model in the provided box.

Yes. A factory reset will bypass the lock screen passcode on your Apple iPhone SE and allow you to access it without a passcode. However, all your data will disappear, so make sure you have a backup.

### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone SE set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone SE to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:

![hard reset iphone 6 while locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/factory-reset-locked-iphone-without-itunes-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the " Sleep/Wake " button and the " Home " button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.

**Step 2:** After 10 seconds have passed, release the " Sleep/Wake " button but keep holding the " Home " button.

**Step 3:** Keep holding the " Home " button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

**Step 4:** Here, you will be in recovery mode, and now you can reset your Apple iPhone SE.

Your device will now be reset, and you will have a phone like a new one.

### 5\. How can I get into a locked iPhone?

If you have lost the passcode of your Apple iPhone SE, then you can use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool to factory reset your device. To do this, you need to proceed with the steps given above. They are easy to follow and will help you reset your device without risk.

### The Bottom Line

These are some of the most effective methods that can help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes. You can use any of these methods to reset your device and get rid of the lock screen.

However, if you want to factory reset your Apple iPhone SE because you have forgotten your passcode, we recommend using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock app because it is the most effective and safe method.

This app can help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes in just a few minutes, and it is very easy to use. So, if you want to reset your device without any data loss, we recommend using this app.
