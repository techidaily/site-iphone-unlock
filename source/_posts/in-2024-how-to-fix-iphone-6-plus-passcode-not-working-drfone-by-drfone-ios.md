### Check medical ID in an emergency call

There is a feature in the Apple iPhone 6 Plus known as medical ID. This feature can help you contact the owner of the found iPhone if they are unavailable.

To do this, go to the emergency call screen and tap on the Medical ID option. Here, you can find out the name and phone number of the owner. So, you can use this information to contact the owner and return the iPhone.

### Take photos to communicate with the owner via iCloud

This is a great way to contact the owner of a lost iPhone. You can use this method if you cannot find the owner's phone number in the lost mode or medical ID.

To do this, go to Settings -> iCloud -> Photos and turn on the iCloud Photo Library. Now, take some pictures with the found iPhone, and they will be automatically uploaded to iCloud.

Most people who have lost their iPhones often check their iCloud, and once they find out that someone is taking pictures and uploading them to their iCloud, they will try to communicate with you.

And that's how you can also communicate with them and ask for contact details so that you can return their phone and be a good citizen.
