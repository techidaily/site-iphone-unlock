You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 8 Plus models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 8 Plus models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 8 Plus mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 8 Plus 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 8 Plus is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and unlocking it.
