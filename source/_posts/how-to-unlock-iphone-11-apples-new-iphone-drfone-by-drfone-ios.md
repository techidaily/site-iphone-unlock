## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 11, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 11 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 11 is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 11 Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 11 is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 11 from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 11, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 11 and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 11 does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 11 in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 11 device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 11, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 11 transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 11 to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 11.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 11 to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 11 and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

![itunes unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-2.jpg)

### 3\. "Erase iPhone" Option

However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone 11 device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 11 and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone 11 device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 11 cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 11 passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 11.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

**Step 3.** Tap the recently added reminder to open the "Reminders" application.

**Step 4.** Click the "Home" button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.

![use siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg)

As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.

### 5\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

**Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 11/iPad**

Open the Dr.Fone program on your PC and select "Screen Unlock" among all the options from the home page.

![select screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Connect your iOS device to the PC through a USB connector. Then, at that point, click the "Unlock iOS Screen" option on the screen.

**Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode**

Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone 11 lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can't actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 3. Affirm iOS device information**

After putting the Apple iPhone 11 device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 11 device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 11 device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.

**Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 11 screen lock**

After the firmware is downloaded effectively, click Unlock Now to begin unlocking your Apple iPhone 11/iPad.

![unlock now](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

Simply shortly, your Apple iPhone 11 will be unlocked effectively. Note that this unlocking process will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 11. However, it is practical to erase this issue from your device.


## Part 3: How Can I Turn Off/On My Passcode?

- Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Fingerprint and Password." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Password." Click this choice.
- Enter your current password.
- Look down until you track the "Turn Passcode Off" choice and tap it.

![go to settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-5.jpg)

- Click again to agree with your decision to turn off your passcode.
