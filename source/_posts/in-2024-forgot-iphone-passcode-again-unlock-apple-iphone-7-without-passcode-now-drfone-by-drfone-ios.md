It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

Before the Apple iPhone 7 lock screen removal, we need to boot the phone in Recovery or DFU. If you have to do so, follow the steps given in the image below:

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

We suggest you open the recovery mode to remove the iOS screen lock. However, if you can't figure out how to do so, go for the DFU mode.

**Step 3. Affirm Device Model information**

After going to the DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the information about your Apple iPhone 7. From the following screen, confirm your phone model and iOS version. If it is isn't correctly given, select the correct data pair from the drop-down menu. Then download the firmware package for your Apple iPhone 7.

**Step 4. Open the Lock**

Click Unlock Now after downloading the firmware.
