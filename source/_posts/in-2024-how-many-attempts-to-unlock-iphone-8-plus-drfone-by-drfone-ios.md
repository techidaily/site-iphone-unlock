## Full Guide to Unlock Apple iPhone 8 Plus with iTunes

Certainly, when this question springs up, you must not get terrified. We are here to direct you through the process of fixing this issue.

Losing a passcode is entirely normal and can happen to anyone. So, if you are also among the lot, we will elaborate **on how to unlock iPhone with iTunes.** After thorough research, our experts have laid out some essential unlocking methods for our readers. So, if you need to get things straight, read this detailed guide to go over your issue.

## Part 1: Why Was My iPhone Disabled?

Using a lock screen passcode to secure your iDevice is an excellent way. However, it can become troublesome when you forget the key to your phone. Moreover, you may get stuck even if your screen breaks. On the other hand, someone may take your phone and type a few incorrect passcodes.

If your screen displays "iPhone disabled," the most probable reason is an excess of wrong passcode attempts. However, this can sometimes occur without you understanding if the phone is in your pocket.

It would help if you erased your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to eliminate the lock and passcode, then re-sync it with iTunes. Then, you can restore your phone from an iCloud or an iTunes backup, but if you have never used a backup on your phone, your phone will have nothing. This guide illustrates **how to unlock disabled iPhone with iTunes.**

## Part 2: How to Unlock iPhone with iTunes

At first, iTunes was only a media software used to play, download and see sound and video documents. Later in 2011, it became a valuable tool to support information and adjust it across numerous devices.

It added the 'Restore' option that can assist clients with unlocking their iPhones when they forget their passcode.

In any case, one has to know that iTunes is not an expert unlocking tool. Apple seldom updates iTunes, and its last update was long ago. Consequently, it has numerous tech bugs. As a result, the unlocking process using iTunes takes a lot of time. During the process, you may experience different error codes like 3004, 1100, 3194, 4000, and 4013. That makes it a tedious process.

**Requirements for Windows PC:**

- For **iTunes unlock phone**, your PC should have installed Windows 8 or later and the most recent iTunes variant.

**Requirements for Mac:**

- Open the Finder window if you have macOS Catalina or a more recent one.
- Open the most current version of iTunes using macOS Mojave or older.
- You must have a USB connector.

**Steps (For Windows)**

**Step 1. Connect the locked Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the PC**

Connect your locked Apple iPhone 8 Plus to your PC through a lightning or USB connector. Open iTunes on Windows PC.

**Step 2. Put your Apple iPhone 8 Plus in recovery mode**

To enter a Recovery Mode, press a combination of buttons on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Doing such, you will see a recovery mode screen on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. To place the Apple iPhone 8 Plus in Recovery mode, follow these:

- **iPhone 8 or above (second and third generation):** Press and release the volume (+) button. Press and release the volume (-) button. Hold power/side button until seeing the recovery mode on your screen.
- **iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:** Press the top (or side) and volume down buttons simultaneously until the recovery screen shows up.
- **iPhone SE (first generation) and iPhone 6S:** Hold the home button and the power/side button simultaneously until the recovery mode screen shows up.

**Note:** If you see the passcode screen, switch off your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and do the process again until you see the Recovery mode screen.

**Step 3. Restore your Apple iPhone 8 Plus**

As the recovery Mode screen shows up on the iPhone, you will find your Apple iPhone 8 Plus on **iTunes unlock phone** screen. Then, a box shows up with a message saying there is an iPhone issue. It will expect you to update or restore your phone. So, click on Restore.

![click restore](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-with-itunes-1.jpg)

**Step 4.** It then asks you to confirm whether you are sure you need to restore the Apple iPhone 8 Plus to its default factory state. It does so because your media and data will be all erased. Then, click on Restore and Update.

**Step 5.** Then, "iPhone Software Update" may spring up. Click Next, and afterwards, click Agree. iTunes will begin downloading the software and restore your Apple iPhone 8 Plus when the download is finished.

When the "iPhone software update" is downloaded, iTunes will show that it will erase your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and restore it to iOS 15.4.1. Then click on Restore.

The above bar will show "Extracting software… ". It implies iOS 15.4.1 iTunes is planning to restore the software on this iPhone.

![extracting software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-with-itunes-2.jpg)
