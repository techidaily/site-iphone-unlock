![face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

If the new Apple iPhone 15 Pro is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 15 Pro from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro 14, and now the Apple iPhone 15 Pro 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13/12/11 with Face ID:

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

## Part 3: Tips for Successful Apple iPhone 15 Pro Unlocking

Unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro can be a delicate process. To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:

### 1\. Check Device Eligibility

Make sure your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.

### 2\. Backup Your Data

Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.

If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.

### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 15 Pro's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.

Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn't been unlocked during this time.

When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to the computer.

## Conclusion

To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro can be daunting when you've forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues. Thankfully, there are different methods available to regain access to your device. This article explored three methods: using iCloud's Find My iPhone, restoring with iTunes, and utilizing Dr.Fone.
