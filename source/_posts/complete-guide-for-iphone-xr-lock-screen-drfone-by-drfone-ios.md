## FAQs

### 1\. Can a Factory Reset Bypass the Lock screen Passcode on iPhone?

Yes. A factory reset will bypass the lock screen passcode on your Apple iPhone XR and allow you to access it without a passcode. However, all your data will disappear, so make sure you have a backup.

### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone XR set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.
