![iphone blacklisted](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg)

### What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?

When an iPhone is blacklisted, it's been labeled as "not-so-friendly" in the digital world. It's like when you're not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.

### Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?

There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:

- **Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That's because protecting the original owner's data and privacy is essential.
- **Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn't pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.

### What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Is Blacklisted?

Now, here's where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is blacklisted, it won't work like it should. Here's what you might experience:

- **No Calls or Texts.**You won't be able to make or receive calls and texts. It's like your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is suddenly mute.
- **No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus will be like a disconnected island.
- **Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, its value will drop if it's blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.

So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don't have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 6 Plus back in action with some easy-to-follow **iPhone blacklist removal** steps.

## Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free

Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 6 Plus to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let's talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 6 Plus free. The good news is there's a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.

![iphone blacklist removal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg)

### What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?

Going through a **blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 6 Plus** is like giving your device a second chance. It's taking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus off the "naughty list" and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.

### Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal

The **iPhone blacklist removal** method is relatively easy. Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Contact the Original Owner**

One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 6 Plus ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.

**Option 2: Contact Your Carrier**

Your next option is to contact your carrier for an **iPhone blacklist removal service**. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.

If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.

Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you're patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.

![how to avoid iphone blacklist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-04.jpg)

### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 6 Plus getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 6 Plus's data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus's status.

### Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone

If your Apple iPhone 6 Plus ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.

### Beware of Scams

Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid buying iPhones from unreliable sources or individuals you don't trust.

By following these simple preventive measures, you can keep your device clear and avoid the hassle of dealing with the whole **iPhone blacklist removal** process. Remember, a little caution goes a long way.

## Apple iPhone 6 Plus Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 6 Plus displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2.** Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.

![android ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3.** You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.

<a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4.** Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17/14.

![ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5.** Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!

![drfone advanced unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png)

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.

It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg)

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary

And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17/14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!
