## Part 3: How Can I Turn Off/On My Passcode?

- Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Fingerprint and Password." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Password." Click this choice.
- Enter your current password.
- Look down until you track the "Turn Passcode Off" choice and tap it.
