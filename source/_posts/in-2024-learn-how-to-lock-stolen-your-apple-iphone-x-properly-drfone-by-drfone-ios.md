Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.

Additionally, ensure that you keep your iDevices' Apple ID details safe. Else, you will not have the option to use the iDevice again. Using iTunes will erase the screen's password but not the firmware. Considering that, you must keep the information in mind to set up and utilize the Apple iPhone X device.

To sidestep iPhone password with iTunes:

**Step 1. Go to Recovery mode**

**On iPhone 8/8 Or more and Above:** Hold the power/side button and press any of the volume buttons until a slider appears. Move the slider to turn off the Apple iPhone X device. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone X to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone X device shows the recovery mode screen.

**On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the power off slider. Next, move the slider to turn off the iPhone. Then, press the Volume (-) button and connect the Apple iPhone X device to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone X.**

After you connect your Apple iPhone X to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the "Your iPhone name" and ask you to restore it. In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn't run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Keep waiting until the restoration completes. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone X and follow the on-screen directions. That will allow you to set up and utilize your device.
