## Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro with iTunes?

Just like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS), you can also use iTunes to fix the Apple iPhone 11 Pro won’t unlock the problem. Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone's. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.

**Prerequisites**:

1. Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.
2. Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13. Go to the iTunes menu, check for updates, and follow the simple on-screen instructions to update iTunes.

**Step 1. Put your phone in the Recovery Mode**

After meeting the basic prerequisites, you need to put your Apple iPhone 11 Pro in recovery mode by following these steps:

2. Press the Volume Up key quickly. That is, press it only for a second and release it.
3. Similarly, quick-press the Volume Down key as well.
4. Once the Volume Down key is released, press the Side button.
5. Keep pressing the Side key until the connect-to-iTunes symbol would appear on the screen.

Make sure that all the key combinations should be pressed consecutively. That is, you should not take an evident pause in between.

## Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro without a passcode using iCloud?

Another way to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro without a passcode or Face ID is by using iCloud. Instead of turning off the Find my iPhone service, we will use it to erase the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device remotely. Though, you should know your Apple ID and password to implement this technique.

1. Go to iCloud’s official website and log in with your Apple ID and password.
2. From here, click on the “Find my iPhone” service.

## Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone 11 Pro?

Lately, there have been a lot of articles about this method. As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.

It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 11 Pro that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 11 Pro currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.

## Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro X/Apple iPhone 11 Pro from being unlocked by thieves

It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 11 Pro from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.

**5.1 Enable Find my iPhone**

This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.

Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.

**5.2 Use Find my Friends**

Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.

In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg)

**5.3 Enable two-factor authentication**

Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings > Apple ID > Passcode & Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.

**5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts**

This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.

Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg)

### I.III: Unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro Without Passcode Through The iCloud Website (Find My iPhone)

If the Apple iPhone 11 Pro had Find My enabled before it got locked, and you have the iCloud credentials that the Apple iPhone 11 Pro is locked to, you can use Find My on the iCloud website to unlock the locked iPhone.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://icloud.com> and sign in using the iCloud/ Apple ID used with the locked iPhone. If you use any other ID, you will not see this iPhone since it would not be attached to that ID.

**Step 2:** Click Find My and select your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

![unlock iphone with icloud find my](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

iPhone will be unlocked and restored to factory settings. Fresh setup will be required.

### I.IV: Unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro Without A Computer (Find My App)

What to do if there is no computer nearby and all you have is another iPad or iPhone? Please do not panic, as you can use Find My on any Apple device to erase and unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro provided the same Apple ID as the locked iPhone is used.

This means that it might be easier for you if you have another Apple device signed in to the same iCloud as the locked iPhone, else you will need to temporarily sign out of the account on that device and sign in with the requisite account. It is cumbersome, but it is better than nothing in a pinch.

**Step 1:** Launch Find My app on your macOS or iOS device.

![unlock iphone with find my app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select the locked iPhone from the list of devices, click or tap it on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.

The unlocked iPhone will be erased, and factory settings restored on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, requiring a new setup after the restart.

If your locked iPhone is not on the list of devices, and you cannot do anything, feel free to pay a visit to an Apple Store, as they will have all resources required to get your Apple iPhone 11 Pro unlocked and working again.

## Part II: FAQs

Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.

### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 11 Pro without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

So, if you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode and are looking for how to unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro without passcode, use this guide to pick one of the three easy ways to unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro in case of forgotten passcode.
