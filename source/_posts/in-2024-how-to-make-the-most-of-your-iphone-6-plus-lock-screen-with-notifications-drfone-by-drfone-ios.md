- **Step 4:** Choose the Restore option when you see a pop-up. Your computer downloads software for your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and begins the restore process. If the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits the recovery mode screen, let the download finish, turn off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, and start again.

## Part 8: Try DFU Mode to Bypass iPhone Passcode

DFU mode (Device Firmware Update) is a special mode on an iPhone that allows you to install firmware or software updates. It can also be utilized to bypass the passcode on an iPhone. To use DFU mode to bypass the passcode on an iPhone, follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Connect your iDevice to your PC and launch the iTunes app.
- **Step 2.** Switch off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and press and hold the Home and the Side/Power button for 10 seconds.
- **Step 3.** Release the Side/Power button, but continue to hold the Home button until iTunes recognizes your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in recovery mode.
- **Step 4.** When your iDevice is in recovery mode, you can use iTunes to restore your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and bypass the passcode.

Remember that using DFU mode to bypass your Apple iPhone 6 Plus passcode will erase all data from your device.
