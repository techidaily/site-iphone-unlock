![iphone blacklisted](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg)

### What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?

When an iPhone is blacklisted, it's been labeled as "not-so-friendly" in the digital world. It's like when you're not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.

### Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?

There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:

- **Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That's because protecting the original owner's data and privacy is essential.
- **Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn't pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.

### What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Is Blacklisted?

Now, here's where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is blacklisted, it won't work like it should. Here's what you might experience:

- **No Calls or Texts.**You won't be able to make or receive calls and texts. It's like your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is suddenly mute.
- **No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro will be like a disconnected island.
- **Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, its value will drop if it's blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.

So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don't have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 12 Pro back in action with some easy-to-follow **iPhone blacklist removal** steps.

## Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free

Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 12 Pro to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let's talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 12 Pro free. The good news is there's a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.

![iphone blacklist removal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg)

### What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?

Going through a **blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 12 Pro** is like giving your device a second chance. It's taking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro off the "naughty list" and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.

### Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal

The **iPhone blacklist removal** method is relatively easy. Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Contact the Original Owner**

One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.

**Option 2: Contact Your Carrier**

Your next option is to contact your carrier for an **iPhone blacklist removal service**. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.

If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.

Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you're patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.

## Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted

Now that you've learned how to [rescue a blacklisted iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html) let's talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place. Prevention is always better than a cure, right? Here are some easy steps to make sure your Apple iPhone 12 Pro stays in the clear.

![how to avoid iphone blacklist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-04.jpg)

### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 12 Pro's data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro's status.

### Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone

If your Apple iPhone 12 Pro ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.

### Beware of Scams

Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid buying iPhones from unreliable sources or individuals you don't trust.

By following these simple preventive measures, you can keep your device clear and avoid the hassle of dealing with the whole **iPhone blacklist removal** process. Remember, a little caution goes a long way.

## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 12 Pro

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In

Sometimes, simply [<u>signing out of your Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html) and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the **Settings** app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to **Sign Out**. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.

Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure. Regularly checking your Apple ID settings and payment information can prevent many common issues with the App Store, including the frustrating ‘Verification Required’ prompt.
