If you do not have any potential source for unlocking your Apple iPhone 12, you can consider using Siri for this purpose. Here are the steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 lock screen using Siri.

**Step 1:** You need to activate Siri on your Apple iPhone 12. Keep holding the Home button or Side button according to your Apple iPhone 12 model for activating it. When activated, speak “What time is it” to it.

**Step 2:** Siri will display the time with a clock icon on the front. Click on the icon to open the associated interface. Click on the “+” icon and proceed to the next screen. You will find a search box on the next screen. Type random characters and hold the tab until it shows the option of “Select All.”

**Step 3:** You will find the option of the “Share” button soon. A pop-up opens after tapping on the button, which shows different options that can be accessed. Click on “Messages” to move to the next screen.

**Step 4:** Fill out the “To” box with some characters and click on “Return” on your keyboard. You need to press the Home button or swipe up according to your Apple iPhone 12 model. The home page of your Apple iPhone 12 will be accessed successfully.

**Cons**

- If you have a version of iOS except **3.2 and 10.3.3**, you cannot use this method.
- This method is not applicable if Siri is not activated across your Apple iPhone 12.
