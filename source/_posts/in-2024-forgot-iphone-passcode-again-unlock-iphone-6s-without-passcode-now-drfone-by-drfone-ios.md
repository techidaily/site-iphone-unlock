Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

**Recalibrate the Home Button**

Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Accessibility** and toggle the **Bold Text** switch. Restart your Apple iPhone 6s, and this may recalibrate the Home button.

**Restore iPhone Firmware**

In extreme cases, restoring the [<u>iPhone firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) can resolve Home button issues. Tools like Dr.Fone offer a comprehensive solution to restore firmware and address various lock screen challenges.

**Clean the Home Button**

Dust and debris can affect the Home button's functionality. Gently clean the area around the button using a small, soft brush or compressed air.

**Use the Charger to Press Against the Home Button**

This unconventional method involves using the charging cable to apply gentle pressure on the Home button. Be cautious to avoid excessive force.

**Visit the Apple Store if Covered by a Warranty**

If your Apple iPhone 6s is still under warranty, visiting an Apple Store is advisable. Apple's warranty covers hardware issues, including malfunctioning Home buttons.
