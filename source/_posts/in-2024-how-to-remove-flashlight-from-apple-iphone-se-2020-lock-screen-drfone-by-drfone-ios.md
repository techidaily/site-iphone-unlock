## Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?

You can't remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn't currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.

Find out the steps below.

Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake

Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone SE (2020) screen with a simple tap. It's handy, but there's a catch â€“ tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don't want any unexpected brightness.

Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to **remove the flashlight from lock screens**. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won't light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.

Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** or **General** > **Accessibility** on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off **Tap to Wake**.

![iphone turn off tap to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake

With "Raise to Wake" enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone SE (2020). By doing so, it becomes less likely that you'll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.

Here is **how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens** when not needed:

- **Step 1:** Head to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off the **Raise to Wake** option.

![iphone turn off raise to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center

The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and navigate to **Control Center**.
- **Step 2:** Tap on **Customize Controls**, then find the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 3:** Tap the red minus (**\-**) sign next to the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Remove** to confirm deleting the **Flashlight** icon from the **Control Center**.

![remove flashlight from iphone control center](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut

Back Tap on the Apple iPhone SE (2020) lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone's back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.

Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won't accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here's how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Touch** > **Back Tap**.
- **Step 2:** Select the **Double Tap** or **Triple Tap** option you're using for the flashlight shortcut.
- **Step 3:** Choose **None** instead of the currently assigned action, which might be ****Flashlight****.

## Part 3: How to Unlock iPhone with Siri If its Screen is broken

Siri is a voice assistant on Apple devices. Like other devices have Alexa and Google Assistant, iPhone has Siri. It empowers you to use the Apple iPhone SE (2020) through voice commands. You can converse with Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) password.

How might Siri unlock iPhone? One can use bugs in Siri to unlock iPhone. However, it is only possible in a few iOS versions.

**Step 1.** First and foremost, enable Siri. You should hold the home button of your locked iPhone and say 'Hello Siri' to enact her.

You need to ask Siri, "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, what time is it in the USA"? That will permit Siri to open the World Clock on your home screen.

**Step 2.** Presently, tap on the world clock symbol. Now, tap on the + sign in the upper right corner to add the clock feature to the home screen.

**Step 3.** At the point when another clock is added, you will have the choice to share the new clock.

**Step 4.** Click on the share button and Pick the Message choice.

**Step 5.** You don't need to text a message. Instead, add something arbitrary in the "To" field.

**Step 6.** Add Siri to make another contact by tapping on the new or + symbol. Siri will open the New Contact interface with details like adding the name, photo, etc.

**Step 7.** Add the photo from the photo library. Tap on "Add Photo," and it will open the library for you. Tap on Select Photo, and Siri will unlock the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and let you pick a photo.

**Step 8.** When the photo library is open, tap on the home button or return button to get back to the unlock screen to get to the Settings symbol.

**Step 9.** When you open your settings, you can now refresh your credentials. This might work by making a Face ID rather than a password to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020).

Besides, it works for iPhones with iOS 8.0 to 10.1. These bugs are fixed in the later versions of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) and won't assist you with fooling Siri into unlocking your Apple iPhone SE (2020).
