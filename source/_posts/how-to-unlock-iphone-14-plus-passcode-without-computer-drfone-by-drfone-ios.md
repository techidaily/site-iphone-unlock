Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?
