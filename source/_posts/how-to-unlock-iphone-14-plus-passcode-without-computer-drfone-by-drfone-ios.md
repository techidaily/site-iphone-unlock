If the new Apple iPhone 14 Plus is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 14 Plus from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 15.

In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.
