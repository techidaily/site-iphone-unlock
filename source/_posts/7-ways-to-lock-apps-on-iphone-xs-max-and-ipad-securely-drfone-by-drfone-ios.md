### 2\. Use Find My

Apple permits clients to erase iPhone data to protect it from others remotely. Nonetheless, your lock screen can save your data if you don't erase the Apple iPhone XS Max device. Nobody can open the screen except if they enter the right passcode. After too many incorrect attempts, your Apple iPhone XS Max will be locked. So nobody can then touch your data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" choice before failing to remember your Apple iPhone XS Max PIN, there is an opportunity for you to eliminate the lock. That is to use iCloud.

**Prerequisites:**

- The locked device ought to have the Find My component enabled.
- The locked iPhone ought to be signed in to your iCloud ID.
- It ought to have an internet connection, be it data or Wi-Fi.

**Step 2.** Click the "Find iPhone" choice from the various accessible choices.

**Step 3.** Click "All Devices" and pick the gadget you want to open.

**Step 4.** Click the "Erase iPhone" button. In this manner, set up the phone and another lock screen PIN. With iCloud, you can open your iDevice without contacting your device.
