## Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country

**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

**Pros**

- **Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By **changing your App Store country**, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to **change your App Store country**.
- **Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. **Changing your App Store country** can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.
- **Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.

**Cons**

- **Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you've made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.
- **Offload Apps.**When you **change your App Store country**, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.
- **Family Sharing Issues.**If you're part of a Family Sharing group, **changing your App Store country** can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.

**Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max/iPad**

Open the Dr.Fone program on your PC and select "Screen Unlock" among all the options from the home page.

![select screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Connect your iOS device to the PC through a USB connector. Then, at that point, click the "Unlock iOS Screen" option on the screen.

![unlock ios screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode**

Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can't actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 3. Affirm iOS device information**

After putting the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.

![select phone model](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max screen lock**

After the firmware is downloaded effectively, click Unlock Now to begin unlocking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max/iPad.

![unlock now](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

Simply shortly, your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max will be unlocked effectively. Note that this unlocking process will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. However, it is practical to erase this issue from your device.


## Part 3: How Can I Turn Off/On My Passcode?

- Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Fingerprint and Password." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Password." Click this choice.
- Enter your current password.
- Look down until you track the "Turn Passcode Off" choice and tap it.

![go to settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-5.jpg)

- Click again to agree with your decision to turn off your passcode.
