## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

### The Bottom Line

That's all about our take on **how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.** We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand. However, we strongly suggest Dr.Fone if you still face issues with our solutions. Even if the above methods fail, Dr.Fone will ensure you unlock your phone.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 11 range builds on the Apple iPhone 11 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 11 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 11 lineup. the Apple iPhone 11 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 11 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 11 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 11 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 11 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 11 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 11 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 11 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 11 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 11. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 11 and unlocking it.
