- Then, connect it to a PC or Macintosh through a Lightning link.
- Select your Apple iPhone 7 in the Finder sidebar on Mac or iTunes on the PC.

![click restore](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-2.jpg)

- Disconnect your Apple iPhone 7, then, at that point, turn it on and set it up. That's all you need to do.

### 2\. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud

Apple allows clients to erase iPhone data to safeguard it from others remotely. However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don't erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 7 will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

To unlock iPhone through iCloud:

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.

**Step 2.** Click the "Find iPhone" option from the different choices available.

**Step 3.** Click "All Devices" and pick the Apple iPhone 7 device you need to unlock.

### 3\. Unlock it with iTunes

Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 7 in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone 7 device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone 7. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.

Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.

Additionally, ensure that you keep your iDevices' Apple ID details safe. Else, you will not have the option to use the iDevice again. Using iTunes will erase the screen's password but not the firmware. Considering that, you must keep the information in mind to set up and utilize the Apple iPhone 7 device.

To sidestep iPhone password with iTunes:
