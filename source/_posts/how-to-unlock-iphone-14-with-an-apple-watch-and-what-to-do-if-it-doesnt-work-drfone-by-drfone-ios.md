## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesn't Work

![man wearing apple watch with Apple iPhone 14 by him](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch.jpg)

There are plenty of reasons why Apple devices are in such high demand. The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 14’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.

However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.

With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 14’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.

Moreover, you might be able to **use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 14**.

Now, you cannot just **unlock any Apple iPhone 14 with your Watch**. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Here’s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.


## Part 1. Can I Use an Apple Watch To Unlock My Apple iPhone 14?

![phone, earphones, and apple watch on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-2.jpg)

The Apple iPhone 14 face ID is one of the simplest, most practical ways to unlock your phone. While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.

With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.

The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.

What could work is your Apple Watch.

Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 14 model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. It’s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.

## Part 2. Requirements for Unlocking Apple iPhone 14 With Apple Watch

![unlock requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-3.jpg)

Unfortunately, not every Apple iPhone 14 can be unlocked with your Apple Watch, and not every Apple Watch can unlock your Apple iPhone 14. Both devices must meet some requirements before you can adjust your settings to enable this option.

To be able to use your Apple Watch to unlock your phone with the utmost ease, you’ll need:

- An Apple iPhone 14 with Face ID – Apple iPhone 14 X and newer models;
- iOS 14.5 and newer versions;
- An Apple Watch series 3 and newer models;
- watchOS 7.4 and newer versions.

Additional requirements you’ll need to meet include:

- Your Apple iPhone 14 and Apple Watch need to be paired;
- Both devices need to have WiFi and Bluetooth turned on (but a connection to a WiFi network isn’t necessary);
- You need to have a passcode on your Apple Watch;
- Wrist detection on your watch needs to be turned on;
- The watch needs to be on your wrist and unlocked.

You’ll also need to wear items such as sunglasses, face coverings, ski masks, or others that prevent you from using your Apple iPhone 14 Face ID.

## Part 3. How To Unlock Apple iPhone 14 With an Apple Watch

![a cyclist wearing an apple watch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-4.jpg)

If you meet all the aforementioned criteria, setting up the feature to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 using an Apple Watch is easy. You’ll just have to follow a few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode**on your Apple iPhone 14;

![iphone face id and passcode settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-5.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode;
- **Step 3:** Find and enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**.

Remember that your Apple Watch’s wrist detection must be turned on for this option to work. When you tap to enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**, if your wrist detection isn’t turned on, you’ll get a prompt on your phone asking you to turn it on.

You can turn on wrist detection on your watch by following these steps:

- **Step 4:** Go to **Settings**on your Apple Watch;
- **Step 5:** Tap on the **Passcode**;
- **Step 6:** Toggle **Wrist Detection**

![apple watch wrist detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-6.jpg)

Now that you’ve enabled the option to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 using your Apple Watch, it’s time to simply start using the feature. To unlock your phone, you’ll need to:

- Have your Apple Watch on your wrist, unlocked;
- Tap on your Apple iPhone 14 or raise it to your face to activate it;
- Glance at your phone while wearing a face mask, sunglasses, or another item that’s preventing you from using Face ID;
- Swipe up on your phone’s screen.

Your Apple Watch will send an alert when you’ve used it to unlock your Apple iPhone 14. If you accidentally unlock your phone, simply tap on the **Lock Apple iPhone 14** on the screen of your watch to lock it.

However, remember that the next time you want to use your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 14, you’ll first need to type in your passcode.

## Part 4. What To Do if You Can’t Unlock Your Apple iPhone 14 With a Watch

![person wearing face mask unlocking their Apple iPhone 14](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-7.jpg)

Generally speaking, unlocking your Apple iPhone 14 with an Apple Watch should be a simple, seamless task. Unfortunately, though, that’s not always the case. A glitch or a bug could be preventing you from enjoying this feature, so take a look at a few things you could try to fix it.

### 1. Check All Settings & Reconfigure

As mentioned earlier, there are a few requirements that your devices need to meet to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 with your Apple Watch.

If you’re using the correct versions of Apple iPhone 14 (iPhone X, iOS 14.5 and newer) and Apple Watch (series 3, watchOS 7.4 and newer), try to reconfigure your settings.

Make sure that you have:

- A passcode on your watch;
- Wrist detection turned on;
- Feature **Unlock with Apple Watch**turned on on your Apple iPhone 14.

If all the settings are correct, try one of the following options.

### 2. Restart Your WiFi/Bluetooth Connection

Your Apple iPhone 14 and your Apple Watch need to have both WiFi and Bluetooth turned on. If they’re turned on on both devices, try turning them off and back on again to restart the connection.

Remember, you only need WiFi and Bluetooth on but don’t need to be connected to a WiFi network.

If the problem persists, you could also restart your devices and try again.

### 3. Reset Your Face ID

In some instances, it’s the Face ID feature that’s causing trouble, so you might want to try and reset it. It’s much easier than it may sound, you just need to follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone 14’s **Settings**;
- **Step 2:** Select **Face ID & Passcode**;
- **Step 3:** Tap **Reset Face ID**.

When you tap on this, you’ll need to go through the process of setting your Face ID as usual. You’ll need to type in your passcode, hold your Apple iPhone 14 in front of you (in portrait orientation), tap to get started, and put your face in the provided frame.

Move your face to complete the circle, then tap on **Continue**. Repeat the face scan process the second time and select **Done**.

### 4. Do a System Repair on Your Apple iPhone 14

If your Apple Watch unlock is still misbehaving, you might need to do a full system repair. As a general rule of thumb, it’s best to use verified apps like Dr.Fone to prevent the problem from getting worse.

- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode.

Resetting your network settings will clear out data from your internet, local network, and devices, including WiFi passwords, some Bluetooth connections, and more. However, your paired devices, such as the Apple Watch, shouldn’t be removed.
