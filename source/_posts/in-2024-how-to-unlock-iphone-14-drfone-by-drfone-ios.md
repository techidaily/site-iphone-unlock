## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 14 is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 14 is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

To check whether your Apple iPhone 14 is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.

- **Step 1.** Firstly, open your Apple iPhone 14 "Settings" and tap the "General" option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.

![check carrier lock from settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-2.jpg)

![iphone is carrier locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-3.jpg)

### Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue

The “iPhone is Disabled” issue appears when you or anyone else enters the wrong passcode multiple times. In that case, Apple's security restricts you from entering the passcode for a specific time interval. After a while, it might permanently disable your Apple iPhone 14 from being accessed through a passcode or any other direct security unlocking option. However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.
