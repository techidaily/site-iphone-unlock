## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus?

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Human life completely changed since the advent of technology. Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.

Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone. Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value. Talking about iPhone, let's discuss how a user can unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus without a passcode.

Losing access to your Apple Watch goes beyond just forgetting the passcode; purchasing a used Apple Watch can also lead to being locked out. In this scenario, you can encounter an Activation Lock. Reaching out to the previous owner is a direct and often effective solution.

By contacting the previous owner, you can request them to remove the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device from their iCloud account. Here's the procedure they can follow to unlock your Apple Watch, resulting in the Activation Lock bypass:

- **Step 1.** Access the [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) website via a web browser and sign in using the Apple ID. Click on the grid icon near the top right corner and select "Find My."
