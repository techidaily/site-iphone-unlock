## What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 8 i Do? Get Answers here

Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But **what does jailbreaking an iPhone do**? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8 removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.

However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It's a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.

To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on [<u>iCloud Activation Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html). Let's start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8.

![iphone devices back view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?

Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8, it's crucial to understand, "**What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone**?" While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you'll learn both aspects.

Benefits of Jailbreaking

Apple's App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8:

- **Install Unapproved Apps**

Apple's App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.

- **Increased Customization Options**

Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.

![circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg)

- **Unlocking System-wide Features**

Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren't in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 8 based on your preferences.

- **Unlocking Network Restrictions**

Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 8 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.

However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.

Risks of Jailbreaking

While jailbreaking itself isn't illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple's security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**

Bypassing Apple's security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.

- **Voided Warranty**

Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won't cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.

- **Instability and Performance Issues**

Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in [<u>crashes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html), [<u>freezes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html), or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 8's performance.

![iphone apps crashing message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg)

- **Difficulty in Updating**

Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.

- **Bricking Risk**

Incorrect jailbreaking can "[<u>brick</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html)" your Apple iPhone 8, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.

## Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?

Jailbreaking an iPhone won't remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device's system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here's how they differ:

- **Jailbreak**

**If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8, what happens** is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.

- **iCloud Activation Lock**

iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 8 to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.

![icloud activation lock on an iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg)

While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can't override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/), leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.

## Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password

Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering "**What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone**?"

Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you've forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner's details.

To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 8. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It's user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.

![in-app instructions to connect iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-2.png)

- **Step 6:** Check your Apple iPhone 8 settings for a displayed MEID or ESN number to identify CDMA network support. If an IMEI number is present, the Apple iPhone 8 device supports GSM networks. The findings indicate support for both GSM and CDMA networks. Click **Unlock Now** to proceed.

![dr.fone unlock icloud activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-4.png)

****Note:******For GSM devices, removing the iCloud Activation Lock doesn't disrupt normal functioning. Conversely, for CDMA devices, calling features may be disabled. However, the Apple ID remains usable for essential functions like App Store access.**

- **Step 7:** Dr.Fone will check if your device needs to be jailbroken. If it does, follow the on-screen instructions to jailbreak it.

## Part 4: Other Way To Remove iCloud Activation Lock Without Jailbreak

If you're the rightful owner of the iPhone, the safest and most legitimate way to bypass the Activation Lock is to remove the associated Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 8 device. Here's how to remove iCloud Activation lock on the web without jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8:

- **Step 1:** Go to appleid.apple.com, then sign in with your Apple ID and password.
- **Step 2:** Select the Apple iPhone 8 device you want to remove the Activation Lock from, then click **Remove from account**.

- **Step 3:** Confirm that you want to remove the Apple iPhone 8 device.

****Note:******If you're still having trouble removing Activation Lock, you can contact Apple Support for help**__.__

## Conclusion

## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 8 to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 8 and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 8) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![restore iphone to factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 8 and unlock your Apple iPhone 8.

When the Apple iPhone 8 reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)

Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn't require going through complex hoops.

Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 8, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 8.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 8.

![icloud find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 8 remotely and your Apple iPhone 8 will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 8 once again.

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 8.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 8 from the Apple iPhone 8 devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 8 and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 8 with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 and return the Apple iPhone 8 device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 8 is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 8 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 8 easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 8 again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 8, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 8 disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 8 device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

![install ios firmware to unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png)

## Part 3. Set Up the Apple iPhone 8 device Again Using the Security Lockout Procedure

Security Lockout or “iPhone Unavailable” happens when you attempt a wrong passcode 10 times. From there, you need to erase all your Apple iPhone 8 data to regain access to the iOS device again.

While there is no direct way to regain access to your device when its passcode changes, you will have to [perform a factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) on your Apple iPhone 8 to make it reusable. For that, look through the comprehensive guide on how to take your device out of this state:

- **Step 1.** After getting your iOS 17 device into the "iPhone Unavailable" stage, tap the "Forgot Passcode?" option in the bottom right corner.
- **Step 2.** To start the Apple iPhone 8 reset, you need to tap on the “Start iPhone Reset.” Then, enter your Apple ID password in the given box and sign out your Apple ID. If you have an eSIM, you will be prompted with an option. Select the "Keep eSIM and Erase Data" or the "Delete eSIM and Erase Data" option according to your choice.

![use security unlock option to unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-6.jpg)

In another case, Apple allows you to temporarily sign in to your Apple iPhone 8 using a recently changed passcode within 72 hours. But once you get into your device, set a new passcode immediately to retain your full access.

## Part 4. Using iTunes To Set Up iOS Device Again

iTunes service allows you to reset your Apple iPhone 8 to factory settings and unlock the screen lock if **the Apple iPhone 8 passcode changes on its own**. Using iTunes to set up your Apple iPhone 8 again is a good and safe method, but it removes your device data. If you can compromise losing data, you can follow these instructions to remove the Apple iPhone 8 Passcode Changed Itself issue using iTunes:

**Instructions.** Firstly, launch iTunes on your desktop and connect your Apple iPhone 8. Then, you need to progress into putting your Apple iPhone 8 in the [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263?at=1l3vrSk&ct=3e7454cbe7984ec49e91a8ace8e4198f). Continuing this, iTunes detects your device in Recovery Mode and shows two options: "Update" or "Restore." Click on the "Restore" option and hit the "OK" button to restore your Apple iPhone 8 and regain access.

## Part 5. Using iCloud To Set Up iOS Device Again

Using iCloud to unlock iOS devices is a safe and recommended method, but it also leads to complete data loss. If you wish to consider using the iCloud method, it is important for the Find My service to be active on the Apple iPhone 8 device. Also, you need to be aware of your Apple ID and password before proceeding. Follow this comprehensive guide step-by-step to set up your iOS device again using iCloud.

- **Step 1.** First of all, open iCloud on your desktop web browser. Afterward, enter your “Apple ID” and “Password” to proceed. After trusting the Apple iPhone 8 device, look for the "Grid" icon on the top right to find the "Find My" option in the list.

- **Step 2.** After that, choose the Apple iPhone 8 device that you want to recover. Then, click the "Erase This Device" option to remove data and regain your device access.

## Part 6. Using Find My App To Set Up iOS Device Again

This method needs you to have another iOS device signed into the same Apple ID with the Find My option enabled. After fulfilling these preconditions, you can follow these steps to set up your device whose **iPhone passcode changed from 4 to 6 digits by itself:**

- **Step 1.** Launch the Find My App on any other device, select the "Devices" tab from the bottom menu, find your locked iPhone in the list, and tap on that.
- **Step 2.** You must select the “Erase This Device” button to remove it from the iCloud account. This will instantly factory reset the Apple iPhone 8 device as if it is a new iOS device.
