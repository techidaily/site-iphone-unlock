## How to Unlock Apple iPhone XR, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone XR. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone XR with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone XR is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone XR Locked?

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone XR does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

A brute-force assault is the most popular strategy for accomplishing this goal, while many other approaches may also work. To do this, one must iterate through every conceivable combination of letters and digits until one reaches the proper passcode.

If the password for an iPhone has been forgotten, this is often the only option to recover access to the Apple iPhone XR device, even though it may be time-consuming.

We are fortunate to have access to a wide variety of software applications that, when used together, may significantly streamline and simplify the process. So, let's talk about them!

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-1.png)

When you reach this screen, connect your iOS device to your computer using a USB connection. If Dr.Fone can identify this link, the graphic below will display.

Before choosing "Remove Now," please read the 3 notes carefully:

- Verify that "Find My iPhone" is disabled.
- Do not launch "iTunes" at this time.
- Your device will reboot in the process of deleting

![connected device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

Dr.Fone can automatically verify your iTunes backup and erase it. Once the progress indicator reaches 100 percent, this encryption will be removed. This procedure will not need much time.

**Step 5:** The iTunes backup encryption now disappears! You may use your Apple iPhone XR freely.
