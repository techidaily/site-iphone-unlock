## Part 3: Tips for Successful Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocking

Unlocking your Apple iPhone 7 Plus can be a delicate process. To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:

### 1\. Check Device Eligibility

Make sure your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 7 Plus 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.

### 2\. Backup Your Data

Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) is an excellent alternative.

If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.

### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 7 Plus's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them.

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 7 Plus 14 actually needs unlocking.

When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to the computer.

While you can't remove it, figuring out **how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens** is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device's battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 7 Plus's lock screen and make it work better for you.

![iphone lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?

You can't remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn't currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.

Find out the steps below.

Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake

Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 7 Plus screen with a simple tap. It's handy, but there's a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don't want any unexpected brightness.

Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to **remove the flashlight from lock screens**. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won't light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.

Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** or **General** > **Accessibility** on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off **Tap to Wake**.

![iphone turn off tap to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake

With "Raise to Wake" enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you'll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.

Here is **how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens** when not needed:

- **Step 1:** Head to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off the **Raise to Wake** option.

![iphone turn off raise to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center

The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and navigate to **Control Center**.
- **Step 2:** Tap on **Customize Controls**, then find the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 3:** Tap the red minus (**\-**) sign next to the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Remove** to confirm deleting the **Flashlight** icon from the **Control Center**.

![remove flashlight from iphone control center](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut

Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone's back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.

Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won't accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here's how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Touch** > **Back Tap**.
- **Step 2:** Select the **Double Tap** or **Triple Tap** option you're using for the flashlight shortcut.
- **Step 3:** Choose **None** instead of the currently assigned action, which might be ****Flashlight****.

### 4\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock


This section will introduce you to our most important solution. Yes, you heard it right. If you need a hassle-free method to unlock your iDevice without a passcode or face ID, use Wondershare Dr.Fone Screen Unlock.

Dr.Fone will not only remove the screen lock but also make sure to keep your identity safe. In addition, it is the easiest method and requires no prior knowledge. So if you are someone new to this technology, we suggest you follow the steps below:

**Step 1. Launch the Software on your PC**

After successfully installing Dr.Fone on your PC, open it and select the "Screen Unlock" tool from the main interface.

![select screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Next, connect your locked phone to the system through a wired connection. Then go for the iOS screen unlock feature.

**Step 2. Recovery or DFU Mode Boot**

It is necessary to first boot your locked device in recovery or DFU mode. Follow the guidelines on your screen to do so. The Recovery mode is the suggested way for iOS screen locks. If you can't actuate this mode, go for the DFU mode boot.

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 3. Select your Apple iPhone 7 Plus Model**

After the phone is in recovery/DFU mode, the program will show the locked device's information. Here you can see the model and iOS variant of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. If it isn't correct, you could choose the right one from the dropdown menu next to it. After that, click the Download button to get the required firmware for your locked phone.

**Note:** This unlocking process will erase everything off your Apple iPhone 7 Plus and bring it to the factory default state. Indeed, no other method that doesn't allow data erasure at the moment.


## Part 2: How to Turn Off Passcode or Face ID on My Device?

Face ID can be a helpful method for unlocking your Apple iPhone 7 Plus - by simply looking at your phone. However, a few clients might worry that it's not as secure as utilizing a PIN to open your phone. If that is the best case for you, you can follow this manual to disable Face ID and depend on a passcode.

Here's the step-by-step guide to the most effective method to switch off Face ID on the iPhone:

### 1\. Open the Settings application

First, tap on your Settings app to open it. That is the one on the home screen with a symbol like the mechanical gear.

### 2\. Tap on Face ID and Passcode

On the Settings menu, tap on the Face ID and Passcode menu.

![passcode menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-6.jpg)

### 3\. Enter your passcode

At this stage, you'll be approached to enter your passcode, so do this to get to the Face ID and Passcode menu.

### 4\. Switch off Face ID

You'll have the option to turn off the switch for Face ID across different activities, including the phone unlock.

## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

### The Bottom Line

That's all about our take on **how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.** We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand. However, we strongly suggest Dr.Fone if you still face issues with our solutions. Even if the above methods fail, Dr.Fone will ensure you unlock your phone.
