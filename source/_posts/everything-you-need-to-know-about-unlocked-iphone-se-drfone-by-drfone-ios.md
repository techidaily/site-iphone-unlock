## Part 3: How to bypass the Apple iPhone SE passcode with iTunes?

Another popular way to restore your Apple iPhone SE is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Needless to say, even though you would be able to bypass the Apple iPhone SE passcode, the technique will wipe the data on your device. Though, if you have already taken a backup of your data, then you can choose to restore it after performing an Apple iPhone SE bypass. Do it by following these instructions.

**Step 1.** Launch iTunes on your system and connect it with a USB/lightning cable.

**Step 2.** Hold the Home button on your Apple iPhone SE and while pressing it, connect it to your system. This will display a connect-to-iTunes symbol.
