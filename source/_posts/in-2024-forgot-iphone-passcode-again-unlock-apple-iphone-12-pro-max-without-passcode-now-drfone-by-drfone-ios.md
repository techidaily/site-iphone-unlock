It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

## Part 1. Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking for Outlook Password

The **iPhone asking for Outlook password** arises from a combination of factors. Understanding these reasons is crucial in diagnosing and resolving the problem effectively:

### 1\. Incorrect Password Entry

Users might unknowingly enter the wrong password. They may have changed their Outlook password without updating it on their iPhones. This mismatch can trigger continuous password prompts.

### 2\. Outdated Mail App

An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

**Creating a new Apple ID for free** is a straightforward process. Let's break it down into simple steps:

### A. Registering a New Apple ID

- **Step 2:** On the registration page, you'll be asked to provide your **First name** and **Last name**. Make sure to use the name associated with your new Apple ID. Next, you'll need to enter your preferred email address. This one will be your new Apple ID.

- **Step 3:** Create a strong password that combines letters, numbers, and symbols. This password is essential for the security of your account, so make it unique and hard to guess. Confirm your password by entering it again in the designated field.

### B. Verifying Your Identity

The next step is verifying your identity. Check out the steps below:

- **Step 4:** Apple takes your security seriously. You may be asked to provide a phone number to verify your identity. This number can be used for account recovery or two-factor authentication. The phone number you provided will receive a verification code. Enter this code in the space provided to confirm your identity.

**Note:** It's crucial to ensure that your phone number is accurate and accessible. This number will help you recover your account in case you forget your password or encounter any issues. Apple may use this phone number for two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of security to your account.

### C. Setting Up Security Questions

The next process will be setting up security questions for your account:

- **Step 6:** Apple asks you to choose and answer security questions. These questions provide an additional layer of protection for your account. Select questions that you can easily remember and that others can't guess.

### D. Finalizing the Process

To finalize the creation process, refer to the steps given below:

- **Step 7:** Read through Apple's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. Once you've understood them, tick the box to confirm that you've read and agree to the iCloud and Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. Then click **Agree** to proceed. Remember that it's essential to be familiar with Apple's policies to ensure a secure and smooth experience.
