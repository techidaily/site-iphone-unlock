Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we'll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.

- **Step 2:** Select "All Devices" at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 6 from the list of devices.
- **Step 3:** Click "Erase iPhone" and confirm that you want to erase your device.

Once your Apple iPhone 6 has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you've synced your Apple iPhone 6 with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 6, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.

Just go with the steps below.

- **Step 1:** To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 6 to a computer and turn on iTunes.
- **Step 2:** While your Apple iPhone 6 is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.
- **Step 3:** When the "Restore" or "Update" appears, please choose "Restore".

iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it's finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.

### 3\. Use Siri

If you're running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn't work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it's not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.

Just follow the instructions.

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"
- **Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock".
- **Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

While this method doesn't give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device's features.
