## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

### The Bottom Line

That's all about our take on **how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.** We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand. However, we strongly suggest Dr.Fone if you still face issues with our solutions. Even if the above methods fail, Dr.Fone will ensure you unlock your phone.

## **Part 3. Unlock Disabled iPhone 12 by Erasing iPhone in iCloud**

IOS world is different from the Android world, and so, both have different and unique problems to deal with. For example, an android user can never imagine unlocking a disabled phone, but iPhone users surely know how to do it. It might be possible that someone doesn't know how they can erase the Apple iPhone 7 from iCloud, so for such users, let's provide a step-by-step guideline;

1. Firstly, the user is requested to visit icloud.com on your computer or any other device that is in use. Then log in by using the Apple ID and password.

2. If two-factor authentication is enabled on your Apple iPhone 7, then hit ‘Trust’ and enter the 6-digit verification code that will be sent to your Apple iPhone 7.
3. Once you are logged in, choose ‘Find iPhone’ and enter your Apple ID and password again.
4. 4\. Then, you are requested to click on ‘All Devices’ that will appear on the top of the browser and select your device's name from the list provided.
5. When you have selected your Apple iPhone 7, click on the ‘Erase iPhone’ button visible towards the screen's right side. This will erase all the data and settings from your device. It will also wipe the password.

### 2\. Using iTunes

iPhone users can unlock the phone by using iTunes. Following are its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. Most iPhones are synced with iTunes, which benefits the user as it restores the latest backup on iPhone after removing the screen lock.
2. iTunes is easy to understand and simple to use.

**Cons:**

1. The biggest drawback people face with iTunes is that the data can be erased if no latest backup is taken.
2. Another factor that causes the problem is iTunes' slow functionality, as it consumes a lot of time to complete a process.

### 3\. Using iCloud

Another known platform for iPhone users is iCloud, which allows users to unlock the screen without using the passcode. Let us share its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. The biggest benefit of using iCloud is that the user doesn't have to connect the Apple iPhone 7 with the system. Just login is required for iCloud.
2. Another factor is that no technical skills are needed to use iCloud. The user needs access to their iCloud account.

**Cons:**

1. User requires a strong and stable internet connection to log in to iCloud and in case internet is not available, they cannot unlock the screen.
2. Another disadvantage is that if 'Find my iPhone' is not enabled on the Apple iPhone 7 device, then the user cannot unlock the screen through iCloud.

## Conclusion
