## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 15 Plus from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 15 Plus and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 15 Plus does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

![find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg)

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 15 Plus in Recovery Mode

## Part 1: How to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Plus without computer using Siri?

Accessing Siri is the first thing that comes to iOS users' minds whenever they [get locked out of their Apple iPhone 15 Plus](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/get-into-locked-iphone.html). It might surprise you, but you can also take the assistance of Siri to unlock your phone. Most users prefer this technique, as it doesn’t require a computer and can unlock an iOS device without erasing its data.

Though, before you proceed, you need to know the limitations of this method. Since it is considered a loophole in iOS, it doesn’t always yield desirable results. It has been observed that the method only works on devices running from iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. To learn how to unlock iPad passcode without a computer, follow these stepwise instructions:

**Step 1.** Activate Siri on your iOS device by holding the Home button. Ask for the present time by giving a command like “Hey Siri, what time is it?” to proceed. Siri will let you know the current time by displaying a clock. Tap on it.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 15 Plus without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

![touch id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-5.jpg)

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.
