### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

If the new Apple iPhone 6 Plus is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 6 Plus from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

Apple iPhone 6 Plus restrictions is a vital setting that is used to lock down a set of functions of the iPhone. These iPhone restrictions are also known as Parental Controls. That implies one can make use of these settings to block or hide songs that have explicit lyrics/content or barring YouTube from running, etc.

It is vital to set up a 4 digit passcode if you want to use iPhone restriction settings. Now, if you somehow forgot the passcode that was set to make use of iPhone restrictions, you need to restore your Apple iPhone 6 Plus with the help of iTunes to remove the previous passcode. But ensure not to restore an old backup of iPhone or else, the old passcode which you may not know will also get activated. Eventually, making your situation even worse.

**Reset/Change Apple iPhone 6 Plus restrictions passcode**

Now, in case you know the Apple iPhone 6 Plus restrictions passcode and just wish to reset it. Then follow the streak of steps mentioned below.

1. Launch “Settings” of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and then get into “General” followed by “Restrictions”. Now, you’ll be asked to key in the current passcode.
