### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 12 mini device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 12 mini, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 12 mini.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 12 mini and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 12 mini and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 12 mini was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 12 mini in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.
