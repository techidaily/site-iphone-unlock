## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

### The Bottom Line

That's all about our take on **how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.** We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand. However, we strongly suggest Dr.Fone if you still face issues with our solutions. Even if the above methods fail, Dr.Fone will ensure you unlock your phone.
