If the new Apple iPhone 8 is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 8 from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 8 13, the Apple iPhone 8 14, and now the Apple iPhone 8 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

### II.III Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically

Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.

Step 3: Toggle Attention Aware Features On.

That‘s it. Now, when you get a call and your Apple iPhone 8 13 is ringing loud, looking at your Apple iPhone 8 13/12/11 will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your Apple iPhone 8. Additionally, your Apple iPhone 8 screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it.

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 8 X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 8 and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 8 device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 8 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 8 device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 8 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 8 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

### 2\. How to unlock the Apple iPhone 8 passcode without data loss?

You can't unlock an iPhone passcode without losing your data, as doing so would require restoring your device to its factory settings. This will erase all of your personal data, including photos, contacts, and any installed apps. You can use iTunes or iCloud to back up your phone before restoring it.

Once you have backed up your device, you can then restore it using the backup information. That's how to unlock iPhone without passcode.

### 3\. How to unlock iPhone using the camera?

If you have an older version of iOS (version 9 or earlier), then there is a bug that allows you to unlock your device using the camera. To do this, simply open the Camera app and make sure it's in selfie mode. Then, hold the Home button until you hear a clicking sound. This will unlock your device without requiring a passcode.
