2. If two-factor authentication is enabled on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, then hit ‘Trust’ and enter the 6-digit verification code that will be sent to your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.
3. Once you are logged in, choose ‘Find iPhone’ and enter your Apple ID and password again.
4. 4\. Then, you are requested to click on ‘All Devices’ that will appear on the top of the browser and select your device's name from the list provided.
5. When you have selected your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, click on the ‘Erase iPhone’ button visible towards the screen's right side. This will erase all the data and settings from your device. It will also wipe the password.

## **Part 4. Pros and Cons of Every Method**

Different methods have been discussed that use different platforms regarding how a user can unlock an iPhone if a passcode is missing. The user might be confused about selecting the appropriate method, so let’s help the users by sharing some advantages and disadvantages of all the methods discussed above. This will help the user to select the best possible method;

### 1\. Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)

The known and famous application among iPhone users helps them recover data, unlock a phone even if its passcode is missing, and whatnot. Let us now discuss its amazing pros;

**Pros**

1. The process is completed within few seconds. Users can easily handle the application because of the guidelines that are shared on the screen.
2. The application is very convenient to use, and it works on both Windows and Mac.
3. Dr.Fone can remove the Apple or iCloud passwords even if they do not have any account details.
4. The application can easily unlock a 4-digit or even 6-digit screen passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID.

**Cons:**

1. The Apple iPhone 13 Pro in use will be updated to the latest iOS version as soon as the unlocking process is completed.
2. The Apple iPhone 13 Pro must be in DFU mode for the process to unlock the screen.

### 2\. Using iTunes

iPhone users can unlock the phone by using iTunes. Following are its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. Most iPhones are synced with iTunes, which benefits the user as it restores the latest backup on iPhone after removing the screen lock.
2. iTunes is easy to understand and simple to use.

**Cons:**

1. The biggest drawback people face with iTunes is that the data can be erased if no latest backup is taken.
2. Another factor that causes the problem is iTunes' slow functionality, as it consumes a lot of time to complete a process.

### 3\. Using iCloud

Another known platform for iPhone users is iCloud, which allows users to unlock the screen without using the passcode. Let us share its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. The biggest benefit of using iCloud is that the user doesn't have to connect the Apple iPhone 13 Pro with the system. Just login is required for iCloud.
2. Another factor is that no technical skills are needed to use iCloud. The user needs access to their iCloud account.

**Cons:**

1. User requires a strong and stable internet connection to log in to iCloud and in case internet is not available, they cannot unlock the screen.
2. Another disadvantage is that if 'Find my iPhone' is not enabled on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device, then the user cannot unlock the screen through iCloud.

## Conclusion

The article aimed to provide users with maximum information and knowledge about unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro even if you don’t have the passcode. Several methods have been discussed alongside their pros and cons so that the user can select the best.
