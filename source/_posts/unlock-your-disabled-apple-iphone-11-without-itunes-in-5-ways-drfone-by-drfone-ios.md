Step 5: Follow the on-screen instructions to boot the Apple iPhone 11 in Recovery Mode. If for some reason you are unable to boot into Recovery Mode, there are instructions at the bottom to enter DFU mode.

Step 6: Dr.Fone will tell you the phone model and the software installed on it. If it is incorrect, use the dropdown lists to select the correct information.

![download firmware](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

Step 7: Select the firmware package after the download completes. After the download completes, you can click Unlock Now to start unlocking the Apple iPhone 11.

In a short while, your Apple iPhone 11 will be unlocked. It is important to note that unlocking a locked Apple iPhone 11 cannot be done without wiping data.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 11 with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 11, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 11 device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 11, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 11.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 11 and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

![find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg)

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 11 and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 11 was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 11 in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 11 and unlock Apple iPhone 11.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 11

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 11, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 11:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

![turn passcode off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 11 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 11 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 11 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 11/Apple iPhone 11 mini/Apple iPhone 11 Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 11 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 11 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 11 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 11 range builds on the Apple iPhone 11 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 11 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 11 lineup. the Apple iPhone 11 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 11 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 11 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 11 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 11 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 11 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 11 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 11 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 11 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 11. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 11 and unlocking it.
