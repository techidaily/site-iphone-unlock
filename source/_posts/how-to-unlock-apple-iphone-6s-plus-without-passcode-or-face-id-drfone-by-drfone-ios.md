![turn off passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-7.jpg)

## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

These solutions offer different approaches that might suit various preferences or specific situations. Here are some basic solutions to resolve the 'Apple ID not active' issue:

### Way 3. Try Resetting Your Apple ID Password

Resetting your Apple ID password is a common solution for addressing problems linked to an inactive ID. This proves particularly effective when issues stem from entering incorrect login details.

#### Solution 1: Reset Apple ID Password From Settings

Do you know your Apple ID and simply need to reset the password? You can easily do so by following these steps within your Apple iPhone 6s Plus's Settings:

- **Step 1.** Initially, access the “Settings” on your device and select the "Apple ID" at the top. Press "Sign-In & Security" on the following screen to proceed further.

#### Solution 2: Reset Apple ID Password From iForgot Website

Are you unable to reset your Apple ID password directly from your device? If you encounter issues using settings, another way to reset your Apple ID password exists. To initiate the password reset process, utilize the iForgot website. Follow these steps for **Apple ID, not active solution** using the iForgot website:

- **Step 1.** Access [iforgot.apple.com](https://iforgot.apple.com/) using a web browser on either your computer or smartphone. Upon reaching the iForgot page, click the "Reset Password" button.

![reset password via iforgot website](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-10.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Upon reaching the subsequent screen, input the “Email or Phone Number” linked to your Apple ID. Then, verify the CAPTCHA verification and proceed by tapping "Continue." Adhere to the instructions on the screen to finalize the password reset procedure.

![enter phone and captcha characters](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-11.jpg)

### Way 4. Check the iCloud Status Page

Verifying the status of Apple's services, including iCloud, can help determine if there's an ongoing outage. The Apple Status page provides real-time information about Apple's service. It displays disruptions, maintenance, or outages that might impact a service's availability. Follow these steps to check the iCloud Status page:

**Instructions.** Using a web browser on your computer or smartphone, go to the [System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) page provided by Apple. Check the status for services such as “Apple ID,” “iCloud Accounts & Sign In,” and other services. The fault lies at Apple's end if the indicators in front of these services are another color than green.

![visit apple system status page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-12.jpg)

### Way 5. Look Out for Apple Support

When all other troubleshooting methods fail to resolve the issue of an inactive Apple ID, contacting Apple Support is the last step. It can be an essential step if you seek personalized assistance and guidance. Apple's support team comprises experts capable of providing tailored solutions for various iOS issues.

When connecting with Apple Support, be ready to provide details about your issue. Explain that your Apple ID appears inactive despite trying various troubleshooting methods. Apple Support will guide you through specific steps or may provide further assistance to resolve the issue. Follow their instructions carefully and provide any necessary information or verification as requested.
