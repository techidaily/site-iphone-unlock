**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone SE, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone SE to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone SE transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone SE to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone SE.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone SE to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone SE and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

### 3\. "Erase iPhone" Option

However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone SE device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone SE and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone SE device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone SE cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone SE passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone SE passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone SE.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

**Step 3.** Tap the recently added reminder to open the "Reminders" application.

**Step 4.** Click the "Home" button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.

![use siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg)

As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.

### 5\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

The Apple iPhone SE unlock software Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will help to open the password without iTunes. It is well-versed in unlocking screen locks from various iOS devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod contact. With it introduced on your PC, you can eliminate your Apple iPhone SE lock screen effectively. It can remove the 4-digit password, 6-digit password, Fingerprint, or Face ID.


Therefore, Dr.Fone is a decent option if you like to sidestep the passcode on your Apple iPhone SE without Siri or iTunes. To fix more issues, such as bypassing the enactment lock without the past proprietor, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will be a decent option for you. The following steps illustrate how you can unlock your lock screen passcode:

**Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone SE/iPad**

Open the Dr.Fone program on your PC and select "Screen Unlock" among all the options from the home page.

![select screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Connect your iOS device to the PC through a USB connector. Then, at that point, click the "Unlock iOS Screen" option on the screen.

![unlock ios screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode**

Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone SE lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can't actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 3. Affirm iOS device information**

After putting the Apple iPhone SE device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone SE device information, for example, the Apple iPhone SE device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.

![select phone model](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone SE screen lock**

After the firmware is downloaded effectively, click Unlock Now to begin unlocking your Apple iPhone SE/iPad.

![unlock now](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

Simply shortly, your Apple iPhone SE will be unlocked effectively. Note that this unlocking process will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone SE. However, it is practical to erase this issue from your device.


## Part 3: How Can I Turn Off/On My Passcode?

- Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Fingerprint and Password." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Password." Click this choice.
- Enter your current password.
- Look down until you track the "Turn Passcode Off" choice and tap it.

![go to settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-5.jpg)

- Click again to agree with your decision to turn off your passcode.
