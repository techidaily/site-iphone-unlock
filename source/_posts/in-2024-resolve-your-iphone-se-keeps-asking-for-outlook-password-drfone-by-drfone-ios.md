### 1\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

After downloading Dr.Fone, please run it and locate the red button **"Screen Unlock."**

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

To start, tap "Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption" in the bottom right corner of the Screen Unlock window.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-1.png)

When you reach this screen, connect your iOS device to your computer using a USB connection. If Dr.Fone can identify this link, the graphic below will display.

Before choosing "Remove Now," please read the 3 notes carefully:

- Verify that "Find My iPhone" is disabled.
- Do not launch "iTunes" at this time.
- Your device will reboot in the process of deleting

![connected device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

Dr.Fone can automatically verify your iTunes backup and erase it. Once the progress indicator reaches 100 percent, this encryption will be removed. This procedure will not need much time.

**Step 5:** The iTunes backup encryption now disappears! You may use your Apple iPhone SE freely.
