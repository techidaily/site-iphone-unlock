![change apple id password on web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover **how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account**, here are three things you should consider:

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

- **Uniqueness**

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

- Disconnect your Apple iPhone X, then, at that point, turn it on and set it up. That's all you need to do.

### 2\. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud

Apple allows clients to erase iPhone data to safeguard it from others remotely. However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don't erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone X will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

To unlock iPhone through iCloud:

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.

**Step 2.** Click the "Find iPhone" option from the different choices available.

**Step 3.** Click "All Devices" and pick the Apple iPhone X device you need to unlock.

**Step 4.** Click the "Erase iPhone" button. Subsequently, set up the Apple iPhone X device and set another lock screen PIN. With iCloud, you can unlock your iDevice without even touching your device.

### 3\. Unlock it with iTunes

Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone X in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone X device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone X. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.

Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.

**On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the power off slider. Next, move the slider to turn off the iPhone. Then, press the Volume (-) button and connect the Apple iPhone X device to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone X.**

After you connect your Apple iPhone X to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the "Your iPhone name" and ask you to restore it. In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn't run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Keep waiting until the restoration completes. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone X and follow the on-screen directions. That will allow you to set up and utilize your device.
