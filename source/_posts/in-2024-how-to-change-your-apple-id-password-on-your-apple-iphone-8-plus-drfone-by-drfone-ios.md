They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

## Part 4: Tips to Keep Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus Backup Password

### 1\. Use birthday as password

It is essential to use a password that is both robust and one of a kind if you want to have the safety of the backup password for your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

Using your birthdate as the password is one approach that has shown to be useful. This strategy helps guarantee that your password is not readily guessed or cracked while at the same time ensuring that it is simple for you to remember.

### 2\. Use a third-party app to keep it

There is a wide selection of third-party software on the market that may assist you in maintaining the privacy and integrity of the data stored on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

These applications cannot only safeguard your data but also add additional levels of protection, making it impossible for anybody else, even if they know the password, to access the data.

KeepSafe and Norton Zone are just examples of the many different programs available. Not only will your Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup password be safe and secure with these programs, but other crucial information stored on your phone will also be protected.

### 3\. Write it down on a note

If you need to change your Apple iPhone 8 Plus's backup password but have forgotten it, you'll know how aggravating it is. Passwords can be difficult to keep straight in your head even after you've exhausted the most obvious possibilities.

Fortunately, you can save your password as a note on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and access it whenever necessary. If you store the note somewhere secure (like a password-protected notes app or a master password manager), you shouldn't have any problems.

Launch Notes and make a new note to do this. After that, you may protect the message with a password and save it.

You may now easily access your backup password by referring to the note. Though it's not ideal, it's better than losing track of your password and starting over from scratch.

### The Bottom Line

The process to reset iPhone's backup password is not as complicated as you think and can be completed in a matter of minutes. You may quickly and reset your password and go back to using your phone by following the steps outlined above.

Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is the easiest method to delete the password from your iTunes backup. This program makes regaining access to your phone and its contents as simple as tapping a screen. If you want to avoid going through this procedure again, be sure to implement the suggestions provided in Section 3.
