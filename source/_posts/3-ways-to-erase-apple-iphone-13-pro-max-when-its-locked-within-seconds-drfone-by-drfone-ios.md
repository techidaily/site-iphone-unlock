## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In

Sometimes, simply [<u>signing out of your Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html) and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the **Settings** app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to **Sign Out**. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.

Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure. Regularly checking your Apple ID settings and payment information can prevent many common issues with the App Store, including the frustrating ‘Verification Required’ prompt.

## Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking? Here's the Fix

## Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?

When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!

In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.

![encrypt local backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg)

Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup unlocking never set by you.

But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let's talk about them.

## Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password

Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.

One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.

There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

### 1\. Try all passwords you use on iPhone

When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?

To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.

A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.

Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.

### 2\. Find the password from Keychain on macOS

You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.

The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.

1. On your macOS, go to **Utilities** by clicking the **Applications** menu item. At this point, launch the **Keychain Access app** and look for your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup.
2. To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.
3. On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg)

### 3\. "Reset All Settings"

Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.

Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:

**Step 1:** Unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, and then open the **Settings** app on your device.

**Step 2:** After locating the **General** menu, go to the **Reset** menu and then hit the **Reset All Settings** button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.

**Step 4:** The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.

You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.

**Step 1:** Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max using iCloud.

**Step 2:** After you have opened the **Settings** app, go to the **General** menu, then to the **Reset** menu, and finally to the **Erase All Content and Settings** option.

![reset in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg)

**Step 3:** Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to factory settings, and wait until it is done.

**Step 4:** Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the **Apps & Data** option.

**Step 5:** Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.

You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.

On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.

### 4\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

**First step:** After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled **"Screen Unlock."**

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2:** While in the interface for **Screen Unlock**, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled **"Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption."** This will allow you to proceed.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3:** When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.

Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the **"Remove Now"** button:

- Check to ensure that **"Find My iPhone"** is not turned on.
- During this procedure, you should not launch **"iTunes."**
- During the process, your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max will restart.

![connected](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

**Step 4:** If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won't take a lot of time at all.

![checking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png)

**Step 5:** The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup never set in the first place!

![removed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png)

You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to "Reset All Settings" on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.
