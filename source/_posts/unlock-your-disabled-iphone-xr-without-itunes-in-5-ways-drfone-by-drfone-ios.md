Sometimes, the email service provider may force users to change their passwords for security reasons. There is a chance that it is why your **iPhone asks for an Outlook password**. To modify your Outlook password from the desktop platform, adhere to the following steps:

- **Step 1.** Open your preferred web browser and go to the Outlook login page. Sign in to your Outlook account, locate, and click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner. There, click "My Profile," and on the next screen, tap "Change Password" near the upper right corner.

### Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection

[<u>Network inconsistencies</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html) can often disrupt the authentication process.

You can also try toggling the Wi-Fi and mobile data switches on and off.

Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.
