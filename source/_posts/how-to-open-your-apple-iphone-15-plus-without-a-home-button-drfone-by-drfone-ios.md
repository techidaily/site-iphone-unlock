### Way 4. Check the iCloud Status Page

Verifying the status of Apple's services, including iCloud, can help determine if there's an ongoing outage. The Apple Status page provides real-time information about Apple's service. It displays disruptions, maintenance, or outages that might impact a service's availability. Follow these steps to check the iCloud Status page:

**Instructions.** Using a web browser on your computer or smartphone, go to the [System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) page provided by Apple. Check the status for services such as “Apple ID,” “iCloud Accounts & Sign In,” and other services. The fault lies at Apple's end if the indicators in front of these services are another color than green.

### Way 5. Look Out for Apple Support

When all other troubleshooting methods fail to resolve the issue of an inactive Apple ID, contacting Apple Support is the last step. It can be an essential step if you seek personalized assistance and guidance. Apple's support team comprises experts capable of providing tailored solutions for various iOS issues.

When connecting with Apple Support, be ready to provide details about your issue. Explain that your Apple ID appears inactive despite trying various troubleshooting methods. Apple Support will guide you through specific steps or may provide further assistance to resolve the issue. Follow their instructions carefully and provide any necessary information or verification as requested.
