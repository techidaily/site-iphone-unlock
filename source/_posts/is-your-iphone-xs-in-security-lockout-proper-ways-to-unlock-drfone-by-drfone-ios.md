### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone XS Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone XS. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone XS getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone XS's data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone XS's status.

### Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone

If your Apple iPhone XS ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.

### Beware of Scams

Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid buying iPhones from unreliable sources or individuals you don't trust.

By following these simple preventive measures, you can keep your device clear and avoid the hassle of dealing with the whole **iPhone blacklist removal** process. Remember, a little caution goes a long way.

## Part 7: How to Unlock iPhone Without a Passcode With the Finder or iTunes?

After looking at the maybe-trick way of the TikTok viral method and other unlock ways, an official solution from Apple, we also let you know how to fix the disabled iPhone. This method puts your phone into recovery mode with the help of iTunes or Finder on the computer. However, a small lousy side of this method is that it will erase your data along with the passcode.

Before you start, please ensure you have a computer (Mac or PC). If you're using a PC, ensure it has Windows 8 or later and that iTunes is installed. Then, just follow the steps below to unlock your Apple iPhone XS without a password with iTunes.

- **Step 1:** Turn off your Apple iPhone XS through the following methods according to your Apple iPhone XS model.

![turn off iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/unlock-iphone-without-passcode-2.jpg)

**_Notice:_** _If your phone is connected to the computer, please unplug your Apple iPhone XS._

- **Step 2:** Get ready by finding the button on your Apple iPhone XS, as shown in the pictures below. You'll need to hold in the following step.

![find the button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/unlock-iphone-without-passcode-3.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Connect your Apple iPhone XS to the computer where the Finder or iTunes is enabled > Click on iTunes and restore your Apple iPhone XS.

![click restore](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/unlock-iphone-without-passcode-1.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Choose the Restore option when you see a pop-up. Your computer downloads software for your Apple iPhone XS and begins the restore process. If the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits the recovery mode screen, let the download finish, turn off your Apple iPhone XS, and start again.

**_Notice:_** _Before the Finder or iTunes restores your Apple iPhone XS, it will back up the Apple iPhone XS data in iCloud. Thus, you can download the restored files after the Apple iPhone XS device restarts._

Now, you have learned how to unlock a disabled iPhone with iTunes.

## Part 8: Try DFU Mode to Bypass iPhone Passcode

DFU mode (Device Firmware Update) is a special mode on an iPhone that allows you to install firmware or software updates. It can also be utilized to bypass the passcode on an iPhone. To use DFU mode to bypass the passcode on an iPhone, follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Connect your iDevice to your PC and launch the iTunes app.
- **Step 2.** Switch off your Apple iPhone XS and press and hold the Home and the Side/Power button for 10 seconds.
- **Step 3.** Release the Side/Power button, but continue to hold the Home button until iTunes recognizes your Apple iPhone XS in recovery mode.
- **Step 4.** When your iDevice is in recovery mode, you can use iTunes to restore your Apple iPhone XS and bypass the passcode.

Remember that using DFU mode to bypass your Apple iPhone XS passcode will erase all data from your device.
