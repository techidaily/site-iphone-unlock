## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone XR lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone XR mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone XR models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone XR models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone XR mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone XR 12 mini was.
