## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 15 from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 15, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 15 and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 15 does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 15, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you.

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 15 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 15 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 15 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 15/Apple iPhone 15 mini/Apple iPhone 15 Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 15 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 15 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 15 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 15 range builds on the Apple iPhone 15 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 15 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 15 lineup. the Apple iPhone 15 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 15 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 15 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 15 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 15 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 15 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 15 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 15 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 15 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 15. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 15 and unlocking it.
