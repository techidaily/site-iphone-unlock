## Part 4: Turn off Find My iPhone using Recovery Mode

The recovery model of the Apple iPhone X allows you to reset or restore your data. It also offers data cleaning and backing up of apps to keep your Apple iPhone X updated and free of glitches. When your phone is lagging or not working properly, then you need to put it into Recovery Mode.

However, Recovery Mode can also be useful to turn off Find My iPhone on your device. Here are the steps that will guide you on how to turn off Find My iPhone on a broken phone using Recovery Mode.

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone X to your computer via cable and wait for your computer to detect your device.

**Step 2:** As soon as your Apple iPhone X is detected, open iTunes and force restart your phone to activate the Recovery Mode. Activating this mode is different for different models of iPhone.

- For iPhone 8 and the later: Press the Volume Down button and release is immediately. Then press the Volume Up button and release it immediately again. After that, press and hold the Power Button until you see the Apple logo.
- For iPhone 7 and 7+: Press the Power Button and Volume Down button at the same time and hold them until the Apple logo appears on your screen.
- For iPhone 6s, and Previous Models: Press and hold the Home Button and Power button concurrently until your Apple iPhone X shows the Apple logo.

Once your Apple iPhone X shows the Apple logo, it means the Recovery Mode is activated.
