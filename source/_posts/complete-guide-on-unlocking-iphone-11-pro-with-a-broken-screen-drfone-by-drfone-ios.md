- **Step 6:** After you have confirmed these settings, you will be taken to a screen with on-screen instructions for entering **Recovery Mode** on your iDevice. If the steps for your specific iOS device don't work, try tapping **Try DFU Mode** in the app's bottom left corner. To continue with the unlocking process, this will [<u>launch the DFU Mode</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/dfu-mode/tools-for-iphone-to-enter-dfu-mode.html) instructions.

- **Step 7:** Once **Recovery Mode** has been activated, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device's information will be shown on the subsequent screen. Once the **Device Model** has been identified, all that remains is to choose the appropriate **System Version** and click **Start**. However, if there are disagreements in recognition, pick the details by hand and move forward.

- **Step 9:** The platform checks the downloaded firmware and displays its details on the following screen. To proceed with unlocking your Apple ID, click the **Unlock Now** button. To proceed, you will be prompted to input a code into a confirmation window. Enter the code and then click the **Unlock** button.

- **Step 10:** The following screen shows the unlocking status of your Apple ID. Don't let the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device lose its connection under any circumstances. The screen prompts the process of completing the Apple ID once the ID has been unlocked. If the Apple ID has been unlocked, click **Done** to proceed. If that fails, click the **Try Again** button and give it another shot.
