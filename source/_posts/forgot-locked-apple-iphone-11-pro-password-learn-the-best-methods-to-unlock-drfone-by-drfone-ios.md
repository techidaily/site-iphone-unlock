There are certain things you must do after unlocking your iDevice. First, you must immediately set a new PIN for your iDevice. Apart from that, restore your previous data if you have a backup. Having done so, you are good to go.

### Can I access my locked iPhone without data loss?

No, you cannot unlock a locked iDevice without losing your data. Apple has made some outstanding security features in their phones. Therefore, you must erase all its content and settings if you need to get your hands on an unlocked phone again.

### The Bottom Line

Due to one reason or another, you may have **forgotten iPhone PIN.** However, it is not that big a deal. In this article, we have proposed some of the best ways you can employ to erase this issue. However, we strongly recommend you use Dr.Fone for a quick solution.
