It's a frustrating situation where you forgot your Apple iPhone SE (2020)'s passcode and are now unable to unlock it. Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone SE (2020), you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone SE (2020) without a passcode.

There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone SE (2020) without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone's stock features like Find My Apple iPhone SE (2020) or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone SE (2020) lock screen.

So, let's get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone SE (2020) lock screen.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone SE (2020) without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone SE (2020) without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone SE (2020) passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

![using itunes to unlock iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg)

Follow the steps to do this.

1. First, connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to your computer and launch iTunes. You will have to install it if you don't have it on your computer. For installation, [click here and download](https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes)
2. Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.
3. Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone SE (2020)'s specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named **Restore iPhone**.
4. By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone SE (2020), and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) XR lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone
