**Step 2:** Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 15 devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 15 device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.

Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.
