## Forgot Apple iPhone 13 mini Backup Password? Here's What to Do

## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 13 mini is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 13 mini to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 13 mini device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 13 mini to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 13 mini will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 13 mini.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!

### 1\. Use birthday as password

It is essential to use a password that is both robust and one of a kind if you want to have the safety of the backup password for your Apple iPhone 13 mini.

Using your birthdate as the password is one approach that has shown to be useful. This strategy helps guarantee that your password is not readily guessed or cracked while at the same time ensuring that it is simple for you to remember.

### 2\. Use a third-party app to keep it

There is a wide selection of third-party software on the market that may assist you in maintaining the privacy and integrity of the data stored on your Apple iPhone 13 mini.

These applications cannot only safeguard your data but also add additional levels of protection, making it impossible for anybody else, even if they know the password, to access the data.

KeepSafe and Norton Zone are just examples of the many different programs available. Not only will your Apple iPhone 13 mini backup password be safe and secure with these programs, but other crucial information stored on your phone will also be protected.

### 3\. Write it down on a note

If you need to change your Apple iPhone 13 mini's backup password but have forgotten it, you'll know how aggravating it is. Passwords can be difficult to keep straight in your head even after you've exhausted the most obvious possibilities.

Fortunately, you can save your password as a note on your Apple iPhone 13 mini and access it whenever necessary. If you store the note somewhere secure (like a password-protected notes app or a master password manager), you shouldn't have any problems.

Launch Notes and make a new note to do this. After that, you may protect the message with a password and save it.

You may now easily access your backup password by referring to the note. Though it's not ideal, it's better than losing track of your password and starting over from scratch.

### The Bottom Line

The process to reset iPhone's backup password is not as complicated as you think and can be completed in a matter of minutes. You may quickly and reset your password and go back to using your phone by following the steps outlined above.

Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is the easiest method to delete the password from your iTunes backup. This program makes regaining access to your phone and its contents as simple as tapping a screen. If you want to avoid going through this procedure again, be sure to implement the suggestions provided in Section 3.
