Yes, you can unlock your locked iPhone without a passcode. If you **forgot passcode on iPhone**, Apple's proper prescribed way is to reset your Apple iPhone SE. In other words, do a factory reset to erase the passcode. However, many individuals can't do this strategy since it's irksome and may lead to a few unforeseen issues. Such issues can worsen the condition.

Therefore, we have introduced some alternate ways to unlock your iDevice. You can even use an expert tool to remove this issue. Keep following us to find out more about our recommended methods.

### 1\. Use Find My

Utilizing iCloud if the Find My feature is enabled before you **forgot iPhone passcode**. By visiting iCloud.com, you can erase your Apple iPhone SE from a distance. Moreover, you can eliminate the Apple iPhone SE device's screen lock to unlock it.

To erase the passcode using the Find My feature on iCloud:

### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone SE passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone SE in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone SE device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone SE passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone SE, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone SE to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone SE transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone SE to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone SE.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone SE to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone SE and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

### 3\. "Erase iPhone" Option

However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone SE device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone SE and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone SE device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone SE cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone SE passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone SE passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone SE.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

**Step 3.** Tap the recently added reminder to open the "Reminders" application.

**Step 4.** Click the "Home" button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.

![use siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg)

As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.

### 5\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

The Apple iPhone SE unlock software Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will help to open the password without iTunes. It is well-versed in unlocking screen locks from various iOS devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod contact. With it introduced on your PC, you can eliminate your Apple iPhone SE lock screen effectively. It can remove the 4-digit password, 6-digit password, Fingerprint, or Face ID.
