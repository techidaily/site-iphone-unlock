2. Another factor that causes the problem is iTunes' slow functionality, as it consumes a lot of time to complete a process.

### 3\. Using iCloud

Another known platform for iPhone users is iCloud, which allows users to unlock the screen without using the passcode. Let us share its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. The biggest benefit of using iCloud is that the user doesn't have to connect the Apple iPhone XR with the system. Just login is required for iCloud.
2. Another factor is that no technical skills are needed to use iCloud. The user needs access to their iCloud account.

**Cons:**

1. User requires a strong and stable internet connection to log in to iCloud and in case internet is not available, they cannot unlock the screen.
2. Another disadvantage is that if 'Find my iPhone' is not enabled on the Apple iPhone XR device, then the user cannot unlock the screen through iCloud.

## Conclusion

The article aimed to provide users with maximum information and knowledge about unlock the Apple iPhone XR even if you don’t have the passcode. Several methods have been discussed alongside their pros and cons so that the user can select the best.
