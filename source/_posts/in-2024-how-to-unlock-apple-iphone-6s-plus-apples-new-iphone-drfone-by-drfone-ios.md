## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s Plus, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 6s Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 6s Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus Locked?
