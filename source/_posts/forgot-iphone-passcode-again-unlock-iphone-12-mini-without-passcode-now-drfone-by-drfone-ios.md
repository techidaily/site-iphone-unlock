## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

It allows users to interact with their iPhones using adaptive switches or the Apple iPhone 12 mini device's screen itself. Moreover, it can provide an alternative way to navigate the Apple iPhone 12 mini and access the Home screen. You no longer have to rely solely on the conventional swipe gesture. Here is how you can set up switch control to **iPhone swipe to unlock**:

**Step 1.** Access your Apple iPhone 12 mini's Settings, then tap on "Accessibility." Now find and select "Switch Control," and within it, navigate to "Switches." Now, tap "Add New Switch" and choose "Camera."

**Step 2.** Set Left Head Movement and Right Head Movement separately to ‚ÄúHome.‚Äù This action will lock the screen when tilting your head left or right. Now go back to "Recipes" in Switch Control, select "Edit," and delete all existing recipes.

**Step 3.** Set "Scanning Style" to "Single Switch Step Scanning" and adjust "Dwell Time" to the shortest duration. Then, turn off the remaining settings under Switch Control.

**Step 4.** Save your switch, return to Accessibility Settings, and locate ‚ÄúAccessibility Shortcut.‚Äù Now, set triple-clicking the side button to activate ‚ÄúSwitch Control.‚Äù On the home screen, triple-click the Side button, as previously set, to activate the switch on your Apple iPhone 12 mini. Now, lock the Apple iPhone 12 mini screen and then wake the Apple iPhone 12 mini device without looking at it.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we have explored different ways to **unlock iPhones without swiping up** beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We've talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.

While these methods are helpful, there's a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that's particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can't get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called "Screen Unlock" that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.
