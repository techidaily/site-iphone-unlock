## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 6s to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 6s and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 6s) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![restore iphone to factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 6s and unlock your Apple iPhone 6s.

When the Apple iPhone 6s reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)

Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn't require going through complex hoops.

Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 6s, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 6s.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 6s.

![icloud find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 6s remotely and your Apple iPhone 6s will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 6s once again.

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 6s.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 6s from the Apple iPhone 6s devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 6s and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6s with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s and return the Apple iPhone 6s device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6s is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 6s with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 6s easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 6s again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 6s disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 6s device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 6s with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 6s is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 6s Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 6s is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 6s from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 6s, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 6s and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 6s does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 6s

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 6s, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 6s:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 6s leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 6s itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 6s device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 6s/Apple iPhone 6s mini/Apple iPhone 6s Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 6s now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 6s range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 6s range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 6s range builds on the Apple iPhone 6s 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 6s 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 6s lineup. the Apple iPhone 6s lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 6s lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 6s mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 6s models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 6s models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 6s mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 6s 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 6s is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 6s and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s and unlocking it.
