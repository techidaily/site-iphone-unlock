## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 6s is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 6s is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

To check whether your Apple iPhone 6s is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.
