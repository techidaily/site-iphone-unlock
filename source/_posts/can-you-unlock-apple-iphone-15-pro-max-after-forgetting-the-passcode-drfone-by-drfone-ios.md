### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

### 3\. "Erase iPhone" Option

However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

**Step 3.** Tap the recently added reminder to open the "Reminders" application.

**Step 4.** Click the "Home" button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.

![use siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg)
