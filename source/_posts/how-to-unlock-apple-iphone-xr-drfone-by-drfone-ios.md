## Part 7: Hot FAQ about USB Accessories on iPhone

### Q1: What is the feature of USB Accessories on iPhone?

From USB-A to the latest, USB-C. Also, most iPhones use a proprietary Lightning port.

### Q2: Why does My iPhone Think My Charger is a USB Accessory?

It is related to the capacity of the charger. If a low-capacity charger is used, your device must regard it as a USB port because the USB port charges at a lower rate than a good wall charger. Another possibility is that the cable being used is flaky.

### Q3: What to Do If My iPhone Not Charging after Unlock to Use Accessories?

- **Step 1**: Disconnect your tool from the accessory.
- **Step 2**: Unlock your device.
- **Step 3**: Connect the USB accessory again.

If it doesn’t work, please contact customer service of Apple.
