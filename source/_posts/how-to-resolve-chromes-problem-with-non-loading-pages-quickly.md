## Elden Ring Won't Boot? Here's How to Resolve the Game's Initial Black Screen Problem

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-4-1200x702.png)

 Elden Ring has finally arrived. However, many players are complaining that they encounter many performance issues when playing the game. And one of the issues that trouble many players is the**black screen problem on startup** . When this happens, players can see and move the game cursor and hear the music playing, but nothing else is displayed. If you’re facing the same issue, don’t worry. Here we’ve put together all the working fixes for you to try.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all. Simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Launch the game in windowed mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Restart your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Check for Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Disable Steam overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Launch the game in windowed mode

 Some players found that starting the game in windowed mode may fix the black screen issue in Elden Ring. When your game is running, you can press**Alt+Enter** at the same time to switch between the windowed mode and full-screen mode. If this doesn’t work, you can try setting launch options in Steam. Here’s how:

1. Open your Steam Library.
2. Right-click**Elden Ring** and select**Properties…** .

3. On the**General** tab, you’ll find the**Launch Options** section. Then enter the following parameters to open the game in windowed mode:  

**\-windowed**

4. Close the**Properties** window and launch the game.

 If the black screen occurs again, don’t worry. There are still other fixes you can try.

### Fix 2: Restart your graphics driver

 When you get a black screen on your Windows PC, you can try using the keyboard shortcut**Windows logo key + Ctrl + Shift + B** to restart your graphics driver. If Windows is responsive, your screen will flash and then the game should work fine. But if not, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The black screen issue may occur if you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To see if that’s the case, you should update your graphics driver to the latest version. This may not only fix the potential problem but also improve your game performance.

There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](http://www.amd.com/drivers) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is download them one at a time and manually install them.)
