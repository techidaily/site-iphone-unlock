If it's been a while since your last update, stay in this article to learn **how to change your Apple ID password on your account**.

![change apple id password on web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

Still Can't Change Your Apple ID Password? Try Account Recovery

The previous section showed you **how to change your Apple ID password** on any device if you cannot reset it. But what if you've tried all the steps in that section and you're still having trouble?

There's still one more option available: submit an account recovery request to Apple.

Account recovery is a process that can help you regain access to your Apple ID account if you don't have enough details to change your password or if you use two-factor authentication. The caveat? Account recovery can be lengthy and might take several days or longer. However, there are a few ways to expedite the recovery process:

- Confirm the six-digit code sent to your primary email address to prove that you're the account's rightful owner.
- Provide your credit card details. Apple will send an authorization request to your credit card issuer, which will help verify your identity.

If you need to access iCloud services and Apple ID features faster, a third-party tool like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) may help.
