### Method 6: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up with Switch Control

Utilizing Switch Control is an excellent accessibility feature on iOS devices. It allows users to interact with their iPhones using adaptive switches or the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device's screen itself. Moreover, it can provide an alternative way to navigate the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and access the Home screen. You no longer have to rely solely on the conventional swipe gesture. Here is how you can set up switch control to **iPhone swipe to unlock**:

**Step 1.** Access your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max's Settings, then tap on "Accessibility." Now find and select "Switch Control," and within it, navigate to "Switches." Now, tap "Add New Switch" and choose "Camera."

**Step 2.** Set Left Head Movement and Right Head Movement separately to “Home.” This action will lock the screen when tilting your head left or right. Now go back to "Recipes" in Switch Control, select "Edit," and delete all existing recipes.

**Step 4.** Save your switch, return to Accessibility Settings, and locate “Accessibility Shortcut.” Now, set triple-clicking the side button to activate “Switch Control.” On the home screen, triple-click the Side button, as previously set, to activate the switch on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Now, lock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max screen and then wake the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device without looking at it.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we have explored different ways to **unlock iPhones without swiping up** beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We've talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.

While these methods are helpful, there's a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that's particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can't get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called "Screen Unlock" that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.
