## How To Fix Auto Lock Greyed Out on Apple iPhone 14 Plus

Auto-lock on iOS devices serves multiple purposes - it conserves battery life, secures your data, and more. But have you encountered the **Auto-Lock greyed-out** dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.

Read on if you've encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we'll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix **Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone** and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven't worked for you, we've got alternative solutions. Let's get started.

![auto lock greyed out on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?

There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:

Low Power Mode

When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.

![low power mode on iphone enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg)

Screen Time Restrictions

[<u>Screen Time restrictions</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html) can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn't run out.

![screen time settings on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg)

MDM Profile Restrictions

If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can [<u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html).

![setup remote management on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg)

Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.

Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode

Your **iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out** because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad's **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down and tap **Battery**. It will show you your device's battery usage and available settings.
- **Step 3:** Turn off the **Low Power Mode**. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.

![iphone turn off low power mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg)

Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in ****Settings**** so it stays awake for as long as you like.

Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions

You've ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the **Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad** or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn't causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Screen Time,** then scroll down.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Turn Off Screen Time**.

![turn off screen time on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg)

Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile

A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device's default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.

Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out ****Auto-Lock on iPad****, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.

- **Step 1:** See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.

- Go to **Settings**\> **General** > **VPN & Device Management** on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.
- Go to **Settings**\> **General** > **Profiles & Device Management** on your iPad.

- **Step 2:** Select the configuration profile you need to delete.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Remove Profile**, enter your device passcode, then tap **Remove**.

![remove configuration profile on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg)

Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM

Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees' iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.

If you're having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company's authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.

If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **General** > **Profile** or **VPN & Device Management** (or a similar section).
- **Step 3:** Select the management and tap **Remove Management**.

![remove mdm profile on ipad](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg)

If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company's mobile device management platform can remove it.

Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss

Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they're associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there's good news.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

## What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 14 Plus i Do? Get Answers here

Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But **what does jailbreaking an iPhone do**? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.

However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It's a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.

To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on [<u>iCloud Activation Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html). Let's start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.

![iphone devices back view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?

Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, it's crucial to understand, "**What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone**?" While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you'll learn both aspects.

Benefits of Jailbreaking

Apple's App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:

- **Install Unapproved Apps**

Apple's App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.

- **Increased Customization Options**

Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.

![circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg)

- **Unlocking System-wide Features**

Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren't in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 14 Plus based on your preferences.

- **Unlocking Network Restrictions**

Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 14 Plus from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.

However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.

Risks of Jailbreaking

While jailbreaking itself isn't illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple's security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**

Bypassing Apple's security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.

- **Voided Warranty**

Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won't cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.

- **Instability and Performance Issues**

Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in [<u>crashes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html), [<u>freezes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html), or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 14 Plus's performance.

![iphone apps crashing message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg)

- **Difficulty in Updating**

Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.

- **Bricking Risk**

Incorrect jailbreaking can "[<u>brick</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html)" your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.

## Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?

Jailbreaking an iPhone won't remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device's system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here's how they differ:

- **Jailbreak**

**If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, what happens** is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.

- **iCloud Activation Lock**

iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 14 Plus to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.

![icloud activation lock on an iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg)

While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can't override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/), leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.

## Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password
