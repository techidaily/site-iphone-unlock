To improve the safety of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup, you should first change the password for your iTunes backup. This will guarantee that no one else can see your backup file and that only you can access it. No one else will have chance to get it.

### Basic Ways for Password Security

To reset your password, go to the **Preferences** menu in iTunes, and click on the **Reset Password** button. You will be prompted to enter your old password and a new one. Please choose a strong password that cannot be easily guessed.
