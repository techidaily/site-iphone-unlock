## Part 3: How to Turn Off Find My iPhone on Broken iPhone Using iCloud?

iCloud is the most secure storage drive introduced by Apple. It keeps your gallery, your reminders, contacts, and your messages up to date. Moreover, it also organizes and stores your files while keeping them private and secure. iCloud strongly integrates your Apple iPhone 15 Pro with other iOS devices so you can share your data, documents, and location with other iCloud users.

As mentioned earlier, turning off Find My iPhone can be very complex. But if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is damaged in some way, turning it off can be much more stressful. Here, iCloud can come to the rescue as it’s the most effective solution for how to turn off Find My iPhone when your phone is broken.

**Step 1:** Go to the official website of iCloud.com and enter your credentials to sign in with your Apple ID.

**Step 2:** Click on the "Find My iPhone" icon at the end of the page. The app will start locating your device, but as your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is damaged, it might not find anything.

## Part 4: Turn off Find My iPhone using Recovery Mode

The recovery model of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro allows you to reset or restore your data. It also offers data cleaning and backing up of apps to keep your Apple iPhone 15 Pro updated and free of glitches. When your phone is lagging or not working properly, then you need to put it into Recovery Mode.

However, Recovery Mode can also be useful to turn off Find My iPhone on your device. Here are the steps that will guide you on how to turn off Find My iPhone on a broken phone using Recovery Mode.

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to your computer via cable and wait for your computer to detect your device.

**Step 2:** As soon as your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is detected, open iTunes and force restart your phone to activate the Recovery Mode. Activating this mode is different for different models of iPhone.

- For iPhone 8 and the later: Press the Volume Down button and release is immediately. Then press the Volume Up button and release it immediately again. After that, press and hold the Power Button until you see the Apple logo.
- For iPhone 7 and 7+: Press the Power Button and Volume Down button at the same time and hold them until the Apple logo appears on your screen.
- For iPhone 6s, and Previous Models: Press and hold the Home Button and Power button concurrently until your Apple iPhone 15 Pro shows the Apple logo.

Once your Apple iPhone 15 Pro shows the Apple logo, it means the Recovery Mode is activated.
