If you are unable to lock the targeted app directly with Face ID, there is no need to worry. There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won't directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.

When activated, it takes you to the lock screen, prompting Face ID, Touch ID, or Passcode to access the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device again. Use the following steps to lock your apps using the Shortcuts app:

**Step 1.** On your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, launch the Shortcuts app and select the "Automation" tab from the bottom toolbar. There, tap "New Automation" and use the search bar to look for and select "App."
