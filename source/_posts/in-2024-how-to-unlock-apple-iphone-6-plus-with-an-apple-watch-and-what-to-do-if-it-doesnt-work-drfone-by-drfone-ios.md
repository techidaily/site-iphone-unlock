## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesn't Work

![man wearing apple watch with Apple iPhone 6 Plus by him](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch.jpg)

There are plenty of reasons why Apple devices are in such high demand. The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.

However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.

With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.

Moreover, you might be able to **use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus**.

Now, you cannot just **unlock any Apple iPhone 6 Plus with your Watch**. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Here’s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.


## Part 1. Can I Use an Apple Watch To Unlock My Apple iPhone 6 Plus?

![phone, earphones, and apple watch on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-2.jpg)

The Apple iPhone 6 Plus face ID is one of the simplest, most practical ways to unlock your phone. While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.

With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.

The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.

What could work is your Apple Watch.

Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 6 Plus model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. It’s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.

## Part 2. Requirements for Unlocking Apple iPhone 6 Plus With Apple Watch

![unlock requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-3.jpg)

Unfortunately, not every Apple iPhone 6 Plus can be unlocked with your Apple Watch, and not every Apple Watch can unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Both devices must meet some requirements before you can adjust your settings to enable this option.

To be able to use your Apple Watch to unlock your phone with the utmost ease, you’ll need:

- An Apple iPhone 6 Plus with Face ID – Apple iPhone 6 Plus X and newer models;
- iOS 14.5 and newer versions;
- An Apple Watch series 3 and newer models;
- watchOS 7.4 and newer versions.

Additional requirements you’ll need to meet include:

- Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch need to be paired;
- Both devices need to have WiFi and Bluetooth turned on (but a connection to a WiFi network isn’t necessary);
- You need to have a passcode on your Apple Watch;
- Wrist detection on your watch needs to be turned on;
- The watch needs to be on your wrist and unlocked.

You’ll also need to wear items such as sunglasses, face coverings, ski masks, or others that prevent you from using your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Face ID.

## Part 3. How To Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus With an Apple Watch

![a cyclist wearing an apple watch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-4.jpg)

If you meet all the aforementioned criteria, setting up the feature to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus using an Apple Watch is easy. You’ll just have to follow a few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode**on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus;

![iphone face id and passcode settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-5.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode;
- **Step 3:** Find and enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**.

Remember that your Apple Watch’s wrist detection must be turned on for this option to work. When you tap to enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**, if your wrist detection isn’t turned on, you’ll get a prompt on your phone asking you to turn it on.

You can turn on wrist detection on your watch by following these steps:

- **Step 4:** Go to **Settings**on your Apple Watch;
- **Step 5:** Tap on the **Passcode**;
- **Step 6:** Toggle **Wrist Detection**

![apple watch wrist detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-6.jpg)

Now that you’ve enabled the option to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus using your Apple Watch, it’s time to simply start using the feature. To unlock your phone, you’ll need to:

- Have your Apple Watch on your wrist, unlocked;
- Tap on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or raise it to your face to activate it;
- Glance at your phone while wearing a face mask, sunglasses, or another item that’s preventing you from using Face ID;
- Swipe up on your phone’s screen.

Your Apple Watch will send an alert when you’ve used it to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. If you accidentally unlock your phone, simply tap on the **Lock Apple iPhone 6 Plus** on the screen of your watch to lock it.

However, remember that the next time you want to use your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you’ll first need to type in your passcode.

## Part 4. What To Do if You Can’t Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus With a Watch

![person wearing face mask unlocking their Apple iPhone 6 Plus](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-7.jpg)

Generally speaking, unlocking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus with an Apple Watch should be a simple, seamless task. Unfortunately, though, that’s not always the case. A glitch or a bug could be preventing you from enjoying this feature, so take a look at a few things you could try to fix it.

### 1. Check All Settings & Reconfigure

As mentioned earlier, there are a few requirements that your devices need to meet to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus with your Apple Watch.

If you’re using the correct versions of Apple iPhone 6 Plus (iPhone X, iOS 14.5 and newer) and Apple Watch (series 3, watchOS 7.4 and newer), try to reconfigure your settings.

Make sure that you have:

- A passcode on your watch;
- Wrist detection turned on;
- Feature **Unlock with Apple Watch**turned on on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

If all the settings are correct, try one of the following options.

### 2. Restart Your WiFi/Bluetooth Connection

Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and your Apple Watch need to have both WiFi and Bluetooth turned on. If they’re turned on on both devices, try turning them off and back on again to restart the connection.

Remember, you only need WiFi and Bluetooth on but don’t need to be connected to a WiFi network.

If the problem persists, you could also restart your devices and try again.

### 3. Reset Your Face ID

In some instances, it’s the Face ID feature that’s causing trouble, so you might want to try and reset it. It’s much easier than it may sound, you just need to follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s **Settings**;
- **Step 2:** Select **Face ID & Passcode**;
- **Step 3:** Tap **Reset Face ID**.

When you tap on this, you’ll need to go through the process of setting your Face ID as usual. You’ll need to type in your passcode, hold your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in front of you (in portrait orientation), tap to get started, and put your face in the provided frame.

Move your face to complete the circle, then tap on **Continue**. Repeat the face scan process the second time and select **Done**.

### 4. Do a System Repair on Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus

If your Apple Watch unlock is still misbehaving, you might need to do a full system repair. As a general rule of thumb, it’s best to use verified apps like Dr.Fone to prevent the problem from getting worse.

[<u>Dr.Fone Apple iPhone 6 Plus system repair</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/ios-system-recovery.html) is designed to be fast, efficient, and safe. It can repair virtually any system glitch in less than five minutes, ensuring your phone operates seamlessly.

- **Step 3:** Connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your PC using a cable connection;
- **Step 4:** Select your device type in the new window that opens;
- **Step 5:** Select **iOS repair**;

![dr.fone ios repair](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/ios-system-repair-1.png)

- **Step 6:** Select **Standard Repair Mode**;

![dr.fone finishing ios repair](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/ios-system-repair-8.png)

If it was a system mistake preventing you from unlocking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus with your Apple Watch, the option should be functioning well after the Dr.Fone iOS repair.

### 5. Reset Network Settings

If the problem wasn’t due to a system glitch, you should try resetting your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s network settings. The process is simple, just:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network**;
- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode.

Resetting your network settings will clear out data from your internet, local network, and devices, including WiFi passwords, some Bluetooth connections, and more. However, your paired devices, such as the Apple Watch, shouldn’t be removed.

### 6. Reset Your Watch and Pair It Again

Finally, if you’re still experiencing issues, you might need to reset your Apple Watch and pair it with your Apple iPhone 6 Plus again.

It’s all quite simple:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button;
- **Step 2:** Drag the slider under **Power off**to the right;
- **Step 3:** Press and hold the power button to turn the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device back on.

To perform a hard reset, simultaneously press and hold the power button and digital crown.

## Conclusion

Using your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is convenient when you cannot use the Face ID feature. It allows you to seamlessly unlock your phone when wearing sunglasses, goggles, face masks, or other face coverings that prevent the Face ID from working.

Enabling this option is a straightforward process, and if there’s ever a glitch, there are several options you could try to repair it.

Did you go wrong when you set the Face ID the first time? Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus? And now, you want to disable the Face ID. Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn **how to remove Face ID** on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.

## Part I: What is Face ID?

![face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

If the new Apple iPhone 6 Plus is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 6 Plus from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11 with Face ID:

![an apple aard in wallet app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg)

Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:

Step 3: Look at your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### II.V Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 13/12/11:

Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.

Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji/ Memoji you want to send.

## Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 6 Plus

For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.

Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11 and set it again if you have put on some 'COVID weight' owing to working from home.

Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode.

Step 2: Scroll and tap the option "Reset Face ID" to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11.

![wa stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg)

## Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus

Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.

Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

![setting up face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg)

Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.

Step 5: When done, tap Done.

In case you are getting the following error:

![face id error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg)

There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.

If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone 6 Plus (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone 6 Plus can be used solely with passcodes if you want.

## Part 1: Why Was My iPhone Disabled?

Using a lock screen passcode to secure your iDevice is an excellent way. However, it can become troublesome when you forget the key to your phone. Moreover, you may get stuck even if your screen breaks. On the other hand, someone may take your phone and type a few incorrect passcodes.

If your screen displays "iPhone disabled," the most probable reason is an excess of wrong passcode attempts. However, this can sometimes occur without you understanding if the phone is in your pocket.

It would help if you erased your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to eliminate the lock and passcode, then re-sync it with iTunes. Then, you can restore your phone from an iCloud or an iTunes backup, but if you have never used a backup on your phone, your phone will have nothing. This guide illustrates **how to unlock disabled iPhone with iTunes.**

## Part 2: How to Unlock iPhone with iTunes

At first, iTunes was only a media software used to play, download and see sound and video documents. Later in 2011, it became a valuable tool to support information and adjust it across numerous devices.

It added the 'Restore' option that can assist clients with unlocking their iPhones when they forget their passcode.

In any case, one has to know that iTunes is not an expert unlocking tool. Apple seldom updates iTunes, and its last update was long ago. Consequently, it has numerous tech bugs. As a result, the unlocking process using iTunes takes a lot of time. During the process, you may experience different error codes like 3004, 1100, 3194, 4000, and 4013. That makes it a tedious process.

**Requirements for Windows PC:**

- For **iTunes unlock phone**, your PC should have installed Windows 8 or later and the most recent iTunes variant.

**Requirements for Mac:**

- Open the Finder window if you have macOS Catalina or a more recent one.
- Open the most current version of iTunes using macOS Mojave or older.
- You must have a USB connector.

**Steps (For Windows)**

**Step 1. Connect the locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus to the PC**

Connect your locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your PC through a lightning or USB connector. Open iTunes on Windows PC.

**Step 2. Put your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in recovery mode**

To enter a Recovery Mode, press a combination of buttons on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Doing such, you will see a recovery mode screen on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. To place the Apple iPhone 6 Plus in Recovery mode, follow these:

- **iPhone 8 or above (second and third generation):** Press and release the volume (+) button. Press and release the volume (-) button. Hold power/side button until seeing the recovery mode on your screen.
- **iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:** Press the top (or side) and volume down buttons simultaneously until the recovery screen shows up.
- **iPhone SE (first generation) and iPhone 6S:** Hold the home button and the power/side button simultaneously until the recovery mode screen shows up.

**Note:** If you see the passcode screen, switch off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and do the process again until you see the Recovery mode screen.

**Step 3. Restore your Apple iPhone 6 Plus**

As the recovery Mode screen shows up on the iPhone, you will find your Apple iPhone 6 Plus on **iTunes unlock phone** screen. Then, a box shows up with a message saying there is an iPhone issue. It will expect you to update or restore your phone. So, click on Restore.

![click restore](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-with-itunes-1.jpg)
