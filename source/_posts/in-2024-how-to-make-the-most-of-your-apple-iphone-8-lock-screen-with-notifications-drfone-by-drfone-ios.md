### 1\. Higher Upfront Cost

Unlocked iPhones often come with a higher upfront cost compared to locked devices. This is because carriers subsidize locked phones to some extent. Moreover, it allows them to offer lower initial prices in exchange for long-term contracts.

### 2\. Limited Trade-In Options

Some carriers offer trade-in programs for older phones when you upgrade to a new device. These programs might be more limited for unlocked devices. This can potentially affect your ability to offset the cost of a new phone.

### 3\. No Carrier Support for Technical Issues

Apple provides technical support for all iPhones. However, carrier-specific issues might be more challenging to resolve with an unlocked device. Carriers may prioritize support for their locked devices. It could potentially lead to delays or complications in addressing certain problems.
