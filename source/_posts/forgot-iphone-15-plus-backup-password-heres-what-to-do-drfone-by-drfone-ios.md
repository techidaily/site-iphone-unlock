## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 15 Plus is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password

### 1\. Try all passwords you used on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus

The typical method that each individual attempts for the first time is to input all of the available passcodes.

Navigate to the **Apps & Data menu** and choose the **Restore from iCloud Backup** option.

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 15 Plus will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!
