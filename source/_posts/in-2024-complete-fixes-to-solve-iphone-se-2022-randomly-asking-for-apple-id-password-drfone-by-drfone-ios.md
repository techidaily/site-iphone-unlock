## Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone SE (2022) with iTunes?

Just like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS), you can also use iTunes to fix the Apple iPhone SE (2022) won’t unlock the problem. Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone's.

The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.

**Prerequisites**:

1. Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone SE (2022). You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.
2. Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13. Go to the iTunes menu, check for updates, and follow the simple on-screen instructions to update iTunes.

**Step 1. Put your phone in the Recovery Mode**

After meeting the basic prerequisites, you need to put your Apple iPhone SE (2022) in recovery mode by following these steps:

2. Press the Volume Up key quickly. That is, press it only for a second and release it.

4. Once the Volume Down key is released, press the Side button.
5. Keep pressing the Side key until the connect-to-iTunes symbol would appear on the screen.

Make sure that all the key combinations should be pressed consecutively. That is, you should not take an evident pause in between.

**Step 2. Restore Apple iPhone SE (2022) in Recovery Mode**

![unlock iphone xs in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-2.jpg)

Once your phone would be restored, it will be turned on without any existing lock.

## Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone SE (2022) without a passcode using iCloud?

Another way to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone SE (2022) without a passcode or Face ID is by using iCloud. Instead of turning off the Find my iPhone service, we will use it to erase the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device remotely. Though, you should know your Apple ID and password to implement this technique.

1. Go to iCloud’s official website and log in with your Apple ID and password.
2. From here, click on the “Find my iPhone” service.
3. It will provide a list of all the Apple iPhone SE (2022) devices linked to your Apple account. Select your Apple iPhone SE (2022).
4. Click on the “Erase” button and answer the security question correctly to confirm your choice.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode in icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-3.jpg)

If you get a prompt on your phone regarding the respective actions, agree to it and wait for a while as your phone would be restarted. Since this will erase all the existing data on your phone, you can later use a backup file to restore the lost content.

## Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone SE (2022)?

Lately, there have been a lot of articles about this method. As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2022). In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.

It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone SE (2022) that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone SE (2022) currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.

## Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone SE (2022) X/Apple iPhone SE (2022) from being unlocked by thieves

It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone SE (2022) from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.

**5.1 Enable Find my iPhone**

This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.

Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.

**5.2 Use Find my Friends**

Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.

In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg)

**5.3 Enable two-factor authentication**

Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings > Apple ID > Passcode & Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.

**5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts**

This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.

Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg)
