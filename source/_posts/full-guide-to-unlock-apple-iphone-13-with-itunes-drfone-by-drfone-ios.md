All Apple iPhone 13 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 13 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 13 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 13 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 13 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 13. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 13 and unlocking it.
