It is a prepaid mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that uses Verizon's network infrastructure. These phones are often sold with Total Wireless plans. Moreover, they are optimized to function within its network coverage area. Unlocking a Total Wireless phone can pose challenges due to the Apple iPhone XR device's association with a specific carrier.
