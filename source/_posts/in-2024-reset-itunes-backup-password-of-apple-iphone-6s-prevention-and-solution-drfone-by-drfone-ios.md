## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone 6s backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

If you forget your password, you will be required to reset it before being able to access your backups again.

### iCloud and iTunes Backup Password

Resetting your password may be done in different methods, depending on whether or not you have an iCloud account. You may reset your iCloud password by visiting the iCloud website and following the steps. This requires that you already have an iCloud account.

Connecting your device to a computer and using the iTunes program will allow you to reset your password even if you do not have an iCloud account. After successfully changing your password, you can access your backups the same way as before.

In addition, iCloud requires you to enter your Apple ID and password to access your backup file. This means that only you can access your backup and that it will be more difficult for someone else to gain access to it.

## Part 1. How Many Times Until the Apple iPhone 6s Is Permanently Disabled?

Unlocking an iPhone involves a series of attempts, each with distinct consequences. Here's a breakdown of **how many failed passcode attempts on an iPhone** you can do before it locks you out:

**First 5 Attempts**

- No significant consequences.
- Users have the flexibility to enter their passcode without any penalties.

**6th Attempt**

- iPhone is disabled for 1 minute.
- An iPhone is Disabled message appears on the screen.

- The same on-screen message persists, but the Apple iPhone 6s enforces a longer wait time.

**8th Attempt**

- Disabled for 15 minutes.
