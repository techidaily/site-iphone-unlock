## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones.

So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 14 Pro with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 14 Pro is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Locked?

In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 14 Pro does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 14 Pro itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 14 Pro/Apple iPhone 14 Pro mini/Apple iPhone 14 Pro Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 14 Pro range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 14 Pro range builds on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 14 Pro 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 14 Pro lineup. the Apple iPhone 14 Pro lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 14 Pro models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 14 Pro models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 14 Pro 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and unlocking it.
