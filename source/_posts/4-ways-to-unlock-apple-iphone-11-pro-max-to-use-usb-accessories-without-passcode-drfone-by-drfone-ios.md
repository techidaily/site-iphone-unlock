![iphone is disabled connect to itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-04.jpg)

Two things can happen on the tenth failed attempt to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. If you have **Erase Data** enabled, your phone's data gets wiped. If it's disabled, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is permanently locked, requiring a connection to iTunes for restoration. It's crucial to [<u>back up your data on iCloud</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html) or locally to avoid permanent loss.

## Part 2. What Are the Consequences After Consecutive Failed Attempts?

When you exceed ten unsuccessful passcode entries, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device takes stringent actions to protect sensitive data. It can initiate a data wipe or lock the iPhone, needing a connection to iTunes for restoration. After a series of failed attempts, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max can activate a security measure often referred to as a "self-destruct" mode.

To turn this mode on or off, follow these steps:

### How To Enable Erase Data Mode

Safeguard your personal information with these simple steps to remotely wipe your device in case of loss or theft.

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode** or **Touch ID & Passcode**, depending on your device. Enter your current passcode.

![iphone erase data feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-05.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Scroll down and find the Erase Data option. Toggle the button to activate the feature.

### How To Disable Erase Data Mode

Here are the steps to disable Erase Data Mode on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, ensuring controlled access to your device.

- **Step 1**: Follow the same steps to access the **Erase Data** toggle. Next, disable the toggle to turn off this feature.
- **Step 2**: Confirm your choice, ensuring the "self-destruct" mode is deactivated to prevent accidental data loss.

## Part 3. Top 5 Methods To Unlock an iPhone After Too Many Attempts

When wondering **how many tries to unlock an iPhone**, consider the following methods to restore functionality. The section below explores the most effective ways to regain access to your device. Let's start with the use of a dedicated screen unlock tool.

### Method 1: Using a Dedicated Screen Unlock Tool

![successful firmware download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

### Method 2: Using iTunes To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

An alternative method to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max when locked or disabled involves using iTunes. Note that if your iTunes is not synchronized with the iPhone, you risk losing your existing data. Here's how:

- **Step 1**: Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your locked iPhone using a cable and let iTunes identify the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. Next, navigate to the **Summary** section and select the **Restore iPhone** option.

![itunes main window](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-10.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Allow iTunes to identify your device. Start the restoration of previous data by selecting **Restore Backup**. Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max will be unlocked with all the associated data if you have backed up your information on iTunes. Otherwise, you will need to set it up as a new iPhone.

### Method 3: Using Recovery Mode To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

Activating Recovery mode is another useful method for accessing a locked phone. The approach erases all data on the phone, restoring it to factory settings. Any data not backed up will be lost using this method. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max with a USB cable.
- **Step 2**: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button. If executed, the iTunes connect screen will appear. For earlier iPhone models, you can refer to [<u>here</u>](https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/iphone/iph8903c3ee6/15.0).

![iphone hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-11.jpg)

- **Step 3:** iTunes will prompt you to either restore or update your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Choose the **Restore iPhone** option to reset your device to its factory settings. If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max exits recovery mode, you'll need to repeat the steps.

### Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone

After **many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max**，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.

![icloud all devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Select **All Devices**, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu. Once you've chosen the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, click the **Erase iPhone** icon in the lower-right corner. Although the action deletes the data on the phone, you can retrieve it from your iCloud backup once the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is operational again.

### Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store

If all methods fail or you don't have access to Dr.Fone, consider contacting Apple Support. You can also try visiting an Apple Store. Apple experts will guide you through the appropriate steps based on your unique situation.

## Conclusion

If you are wondering **how many passcode attempts on iPhone** will lock your device and not sure how to fix this issue, here is the way to go. Methods like iTunes, Recovery Mode, iCloud, or seeking Apple Support all offer potential solutions.

Consider using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) for a secure and data-preserving unlock. It safeguards your data even if you forget your passcode.
