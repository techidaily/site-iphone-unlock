## Part 2: FAQs

### How can I change my PIN on my iPhone?

- Open your Settings app and peer down until you see the passcode menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Touch ID and Passcode." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Passcode."

- Enter your existing code or create a new one.
- Toggle on the "Turn Passcode Off" option.
- Click again to agree, and you're good to go.

### What to do after unlocking my iPhone?

There are certain things you must do after unlocking your iDevice. First, you must immediately set a new PIN for your iDevice. Apart from that, restore your previous data if you have a backup. Having done so, you are good to go.

### Can I access my locked iPhone without data loss?

No, you cannot unlock a locked iDevice without losing your data. Apple has made some outstanding security features in their phones. Therefore, you must erase all its content and settings if you need to get your hands on an unlocked phone again.
