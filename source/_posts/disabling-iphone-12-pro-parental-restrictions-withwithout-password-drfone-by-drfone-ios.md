### Fix 3. Remove the Cover or Case

Sometimes, an unresponsive swipe-up gesture on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro could be due to interference caused by a protective cover or case. The cover might be too thick, improperly aligned, or interfering with the touch sensitivity of the screen. Gently remove the protective cover or case from your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. Inspect the screen for any dust, debris, or smudges while the cover is removed. Utilize a clean, soft cloth to wipe the screen.

### Fix 4. Clean iPhone Screen or Remove Screen Protector

An unresponsive swipe-up gesture on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro might be due to dirt, smudges, or interference caused by a screen protector. Power off your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to prevent accidental taps during the cleaning process. Carefully clean the screen by softly rubbing it with a fresh and dry microfiber cloth. In addition, ensure the cloth is soft and free from any debris that might scratch the screen.

### Fix 5. Activate Control Center Access on the Lock Screen

If your Apple iPhone 12 Pro swipe-up gesture isn't working specifically on the lock screen to access the Control Center, it might be due to settings restricting its accessibility. Enabling Control Center access on the lock screen allows you to swipe up from the bottom edge. Follow these steps to ensure Control Center access is enabled on the lock screen and fix the **iPhone swipe up not working**:

**Step 1.** On your iOS device, access the “Settings” app and launch it. Now scroll down to find and tap "Face ID & Passcode."

It ensures that the swipe-up gesture from the bottom edge of the screen functions. Here's how to enable Control Center access within apps:

**Instructions:** Navigate to Settings on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and access "Control Center." On the following screen, activate the toggle next to "Access Within Apps." It will allow you to access the Control Center when using apps.
