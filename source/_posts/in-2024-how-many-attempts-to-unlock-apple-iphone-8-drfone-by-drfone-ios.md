## Part 6: FAQs about iPhone Screen Lock

1. **How many counts do I have to unlock my iPhone?**

You have around ten entries to unlock your Apple iPhone 8, after which the Apple iPhone 8 device will be completely locked. After the 5<sup>th</sup> wrong entry, you are expected to wait for a minute until you try again. After the 10<sup>th</sup> wrong entry, the Apple iPhone 8 device gets locked out and allows you to connect to iTunes.

2. **Is it possible to reset the Apple iPhone 8 passcode with an Apple ID?**

No, you cannot reset the Apple iPhone 8 passcode using Apple ID. Both are different security measures and cannot reset one using another.

3. **What should I know about the screen time passcode?**

Parental controls on iPhones use a different passcode to restrict content. It includes restricting things like privacy, game center, web content, explicit content, iTunes app and purchases. It is also known as a restriction passcode.

4. **Can Apple reset a forgotten iPhone passcode?**

No, Apple cannot reset the forgotten iPhone passcode. However, they will help you with the steps to erase, reset, and recover the phone. You must prove yourself to be the Apple iPhone 8 device owner, so keep the purchase receipt with you.
