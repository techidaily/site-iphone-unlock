### Way 3. Unlocking Apple Watch Activation Lock by Contacting Previous Owner

Losing access to your Apple Watch goes beyond just forgetting the passcode; purchasing a used Apple Watch can also lead to being locked out. In this scenario, you can encounter an Activation Lock. Reaching out to the previous owner is a direct and often effective solution.

By contacting the previous owner, you can request them to remove the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device from their iCloud account. Here's the procedure they can follow to unlock your Apple Watch, resulting in the Activation Lock bypass:

- **Step 1.** Access the [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) website via a web browser and sign in using the Apple ID. Click on the grid icon near the top right corner and select "Find My."

- **Step 2.** Once there, choose your Apple Watch from the "All Devices" list. Opt for "Erase This Device" from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device's pop-up menu. Finally, adhere to the on-screen instructions to finalize the process.
