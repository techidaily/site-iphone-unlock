### Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?

There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:

- **Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That's because protecting the original owner's data and privacy is essential.
- **Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn't pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.

- **Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, its value will drop if it's blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.

So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don't have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 8 Plus back in action with some easy-to-follow **iPhone blacklist removal** steps.

## Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free

Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 8 Plus to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let's talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 8 Plus free. The good news is there's a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.

![iphone blacklist removal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg)

### What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?

Going through a **blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 8 Plus** is like giving your device a second chance. It's taking your Apple iPhone 8 Plus off the "naughty list" and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.

### Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal

The **iPhone blacklist removal** method is relatively easy. Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Contact the Original Owner**

One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 8 Plus ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.

**Option 2: Contact Your Carrier**

Your next option is to contact your carrier for an **iPhone blacklist removal service**. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.

If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.

Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you're patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.

## Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted

Now that you've learned how to [rescue a blacklisted iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html) let's talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place. Prevention is always better than a cure, right? Here are some easy steps to make sure your Apple iPhone 8 Plus stays in the clear.

![how to avoid iphone blacklist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-04.jpg)

### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 8 Plus getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 8 Plus's data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 8 Plus's status.

### Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone

If your Apple iPhone 8 Plus ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.

### Beware of Scams

Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid buying iPhones from unreliable sources or individuals you don't trust.

By following these simple preventive measures, you can keep your device clear and avoid the hassle of dealing with the whole **iPhone blacklist removal** process. Remember, a little caution goes a long way.

- **Step 3:** Follow the on-screen instructions to reset your password or recover your account.

Reset Your Apple ID Password Using a Family Device

Losing your phone or being unable to access your iOS device can be a major inconvenience. But it doesn't have to mean you're locked out of your Apple ID account. Even if you don't have your Apple device with you, you can still reset your password and get back to using your family's Apple devices.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Apple Support** app or download it from the App Store if not yet installed.
- **Step 2:** From the **Support Tools** section, select **Reset Password**.
- **Step 3:** Select **A different Apple ID** and tap **Continue.**

- **Step 4:** Follow the in-app guide to reset your Apple ID password.

You can also designate a friend or family member you trust as your account recovery contact. They can help you reset your password if you forget it by providing a recovery code upon request.

Still Can't Change Your Apple ID Password? Try Account Recovery

The previous section showed you **how to change your Apple ID password** on any device if you cannot reset it. But what if you've tried all the steps in that section and you're still having trouble?

There's still one more option available: submit an account recovery request to Apple.

Account recovery is a process that can help you regain access to your Apple ID account if you don't have enough details to change your password or if you use two-factor authentication. The caveat? Account recovery can be lengthy and might take several days or longer. However, there are a few ways to expedite the recovery process:

- Confirm the six-digit code sent to your primary email address to prove that you're the account's rightful owner.
- Provide your credit card details. Apple will send an authorization request to your credit card issuer, which will help verify your identity.
