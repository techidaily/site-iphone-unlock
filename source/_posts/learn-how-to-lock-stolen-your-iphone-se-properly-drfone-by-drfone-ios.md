There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone SE without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone's stock features like Find My Apple iPhone SE or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone SE lock screen.

So, let's get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone SE lock screen.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone SE without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone SE without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone SE passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

![using itunes to unlock iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg)

4. By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone SE, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone SE XR lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone
