- **Step 4:** Go to the **Delete** icon next to your mobile number and follow the directions given.
- **Step 5:** Enter the code sent to the mobile number you added as your new Apple ID to verify it.
- **Step 6:** Log into all Apple services using your new Apple ID.

Even if you can't **change your Apple ID on your iPad** to a mobile phone number, you can still associate it with a phone number on your account page. It means you can [<u>use a different email address or mobile phone number to log in to your Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/apple-account/how-to-remove-phone-number-from-apple-id.html). See the next sections for more information on the workarounds you can try.

## Part 3: What To Do if You Cannot Change Your Apple ID on iPad?

**Changing your Apple ID on an iPad** is usually easy. However, there can be setbacks during the process. Now, here's what to do if you find yourself unable to do it and why it might be happening:

Try Again Later

If you encounter errors during the process, give it a little time and try again. Mayne it is because you **changed your Apple ID on your iPad** to an iCloud email address within 30 days.

![change apple id to icloud email](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-07.jpg)

Check if Apple ID Is Already in Use

Apple IDs are unique, and you can't have two identical ones. If you're trying to change your Apple ID to one that's already in use, you'll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn't already taken. Remove it from the family member's account if they are using it.

Your Apple ID Is an Email Address

If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won't be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.

If you've addressed these issues and still can't change your Apple ID, don't worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges. Contact them for guidance and solutions tailored to your situation.

However, if you can't **change your Apple ID on your iPad** because you forgot or don't have access to the password, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone. This tool is easy to use and can help you unlock your iPad and remove the Apple ID in a few clicks.

## Part 4: Using <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>

Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) tool is your go-to solution for unlocking iOS devices without a passcode. The best part? It is easy to use for users of all technical backgrounds. With Dr.Fone, you can unlock iOS screens protected by 4 to 6-digit passcodes, Face ID, Touch ID, and more.

But it doesn't stop there; Dr.Fone can also help [<u>remove the iCloud activation lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html), unlock Apple ID without a password, and much more. This powerful tool is a lifesaver for iOS users, supporting the latest iPadOS 17, iOS 17, and iPhone 14.

Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Apple ID on iPad Using Dr.Fone

Dr.Fone can bypass the Find My/Find My iPhone feature to remove your Apple ID from your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. Follow the steps below to learn how to use this feature on your iOS device.

Best Practices To Secure Your iOS Data

**Changing your Apple ID on your iPad** can be a great way to protect your privacy and security. However, it's important to take steps to ensure that your iOS data remains safe during the process. Here are some tips to help you do just that:

- **Backup Your Files**

Before you **change your Apple ID on your iPad**, create a [<u>backup of your data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup/backup-iphone-with-broken-screen.html) so you don't lose important files. You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.

Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you're getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.

- **Password Check**

Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.

- **Avoid Sharing an Apple ID**

It's best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It's simple and highly effective.

## Conclusion

**Changing your Apple ID on your iPad** or other iOS devices is a simple process that can help you protect your privacy and information. With the tips above, you can ensure your iOS data is safe and secure during the switch.

And if you need to remove your Apple ID without a password, Dr.Fone is a good option. Dr.Fone is a powerful iOS toolkit that can help you with various phone solutions. It's easy to use and can help you solve mobile problems in just a few minutes.
