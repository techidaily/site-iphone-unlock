## Part 4: About data loss after unlocking Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max passcode

As you can see, in all the above-mentioned solutions, your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max data would be lost while unlocking its passcode. This is because, as of now, there is no way to unlock an iPhone without restoring it. Needless to say, while restoring a device, its data is automatically lost. Since Apple is quite concerned about the security of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and the sensitivity of its data, it doesn’t let users unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device without losing their data.

Even though lots of users have complained about this issue, Apple hasn’t come up with a solution yet. The best way to avoid this scenario is by taking a regular backup of your data. You can either backup your data on iCloud, via iTunes, or by using any third-party tool as well. In this way, you won’t be able to lose your important files while unlocking your device’s passcode.
