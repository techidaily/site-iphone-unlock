So let's get started.

## Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode

Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we'll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.

### 1\. Use Find My iPhone

If you've activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn't require any technical knowledge or special tools.

![find My Apple iPhone 13 mini](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg)

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you've synced your Apple iPhone 13 mini with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 mini, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.

![with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg)

Just go with the steps below.

- **Step 1:** To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to a computer and turn on iTunes.
- **Step 2:** While your Apple iPhone 13 mini is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.
- **Step 3:** When the "Restore" or "Update" appears, please choose "Restore".

iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it's finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.

### 3\. Use Siri

If you're running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn't work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it's not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.

![siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg)

Just follow the instructions.

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"
- **Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock".
- **Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

While this method doesn't give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device's features.

## Part 1: What Is an Unlocked iPhone 15?

An unlocked smartphone, in essence, is a device that isn't tied to a specific carrier or network. Locked phones come pre-configured to work only with a particular carrier's SIM card. In comparison, unlocked phones provide users with the freedom to choose their preferred carrier. It also means they can switch between networks at will.

The Apple iPhone 13 mini 15 Series is renowned for its integration of cutting-edge technology. However, what truly sets the unlocked iPhone 15 Series apart is its unlocked status. It enables users to take control of their network choices and redefine their connectivity.

## Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Buying an Unlocked iPhone 15?

Purchasing an unlocked iPhone 15 isn't just about owning a high-end smartphone. It is a strategic decision that unlocks a plethora of advantages tailored to the modern user. Below are some compelling benefits that come with opting for an **unlocked iPhone 15 Pro Max**:

### 1\. Network Freedom

One of the standout advantages of an unlocked iPhone 15 is the freedom to choose any carrier. Users can easily switch between carriers. It allows them to select the one that offers the best coverage, pricing, and customer service. Thus, avoiding being restricted to a particular carrier's offerings.

### 2\. Global Accessibility

Unlocked iPhones are a traveler's dream. With an unlocked device, you can insert a local SIM card when abroad. It lets you sidestep the exorbitant international roaming charges. This feature allows you to maintain connectivity without constraints. This makes it an ideal companion for international adventurers.

### 3\. No Contracts

Locked smartphones often come with binding carrier contracts. These can extend for two years or more. With an unlocked iPhone 15, you can avoid lengthy contracts. It puts you in control of your financial commitments and enables you to change your plan as you see fit.

### 4\. Resale Value

Unlocked iPhones have a higher resale value than their locked counterparts. The broader appeal and flexibility of an unlocked device make it an attractive option. It is true for most potential buyers in the second-hand market.

## Part 3: What Are the Drawbacks of Buying an Unlocked iPhone 15?

Unlocked iPhone 15 Series presents a world of advantages. However, it's essential to approach any decision with a balanced perspective. Given below are the potential drawbacks associated with purchasing an **iPhone 15 Pro unlocked**:
