### 1\. Use Find My iPhone

- **Step 2:** Select "All Devices" at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 13 mini from the list of devices.
- **Step 3:** Click "Erase iPhone" and confirm that you want to erase your device.

Once your Apple iPhone 13 mini has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you've synced your Apple iPhone 13 mini with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 mini, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.

![with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg)
