This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your Apple iPhone SE passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.


## How Can I Turn On/Off the Passcode on My iPhone?

If you want to turn the Passcode ON your Apple iPhone SE, then follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Go to 'Settings' and select 'Touch ID & Passcode' (if you're using an iPhone with Touch ID). If you're using an iPhone without a Touch ID, select 'Passcode.'

**Step 2:** Enter your current Passcode when prompted.

**Step 3:** Scroll down and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'ON' position.

**Step 4:** Enter a new 6-digit passcode when prompted. Then, please enter it again to confirm.

That's it! Your Passcode is now turned ON, and your device is more secure than ever.

To shut down the Passcode on your Apple iPhone SE, follow the steps above and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'OFF' position.

### The Bottom Line

As you see in the article, there are some ways to reset your Apple iPhone SE passcode. However, if you're looking for an easy and effective solution, we recommend using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock. It is a professional tool that can unlock your Apple iPhone SE without a passcode. Plus, it doesn't cause any damage to the Apple iPhone SE device, which is always a good thing.

If you're not interested in using a third-party tool, you can try one of the methods mentioned above. But keep in mind that these methods may only work on some iPhones. So, if you need help deciding which way to use it, we recommend going with Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock.
