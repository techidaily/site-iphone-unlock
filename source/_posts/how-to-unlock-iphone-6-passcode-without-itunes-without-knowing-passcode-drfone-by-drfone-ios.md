If it's been a while since your last update, stay in this article to learn **how to change your Apple ID password on your account**.

![change apple id password on web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 6 is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 6 is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

To check whether your Apple iPhone 6 is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.

- **Step 1.** Firstly, open your Apple iPhone 6 "Settings" and tap the "General" option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.

![check carrier lock from settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-2.jpg)

- **Step 2.** After that, choose the “Carrier Lock" option to see the restrictions. If your Apple iPhone 6 is unlocked, it will not show any SIM restriction. If you see the “SIM Locked” restriction, your Apple iPhone 6 is locked.

![iphone is carrier locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-3.jpg)

### Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue

The “iPhone is Disabled” issue appears when you or anyone else enters the wrong passcode multiple times. In that case, Apple's security restricts you from entering the passcode for a specific time interval. After a while, it might permanently disable your Apple iPhone 6 from being accessed through a passcode or any other direct security unlocking option. However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.
