An unlocked smartphone, in essence, is a device that isn't tied to a specific carrier or network. Locked phones come pre-configured to work only with a particular carrier's SIM card. In comparison, unlocked phones provide users with the freedom to choose their preferred carrier. It also means they can switch between networks at will.

The Apple iPhone 14 Pro 15 Series is renowned for its integration of cutting-edge technology. However, what truly sets the unlocked iPhone 15 Series apart is its unlocked status. It enables users to take control of their network choices and redefine their connectivity.

### 1\. Network Freedom

One of the standout advantages of an unlocked iPhone 15 is the freedom to choose any carrier. Users can easily switch between carriers. It allows them to select the one that offers the best coverage, pricing, and customer service. Thus, avoiding being restricted to a particular carrier's offerings.

### 2\. Global Accessibility

Unlocked iPhones are a traveler's dream. With an unlocked device, you can insert a local SIM card when abroad. It lets you sidestep the exorbitant international roaming charges. This feature allows you to maintain connectivity without constraints. This makes it an ideal companion for international adventurers.

### 3\. No Contracts

### 4\. Resale Value

Unlocked iPhones have a higher resale value than their locked counterparts. The broader appeal and flexibility of an unlocked device make it an attractive option. It is true for most potential buyers in the second-hand market.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesn't Work

![man wearing apple watch with Apple iPhone 14 Pro by him](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch.jpg)

There are plenty of reasons why Apple devices are in such high demand. The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.

However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.

With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.

Moreover, you might be able to **use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro**.

Now, you cannot just **unlock any Apple iPhone 14 Pro with your Watch**. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Here’s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.


## Part 1. Can I Use an Apple Watch To Unlock My Apple iPhone 14 Pro?

![phone, earphones, and apple watch on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-2.jpg)

The Apple iPhone 14 Pro face ID is one of the simplest, most practical ways to unlock your phone. While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.

With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.

The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.

What could work is your Apple Watch.

Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 14 Pro model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. It’s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.

## Part 2. Requirements for Unlocking Apple iPhone 14 Pro With Apple Watch

![unlock requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-3.jpg)

Unfortunately, not every Apple iPhone 14 Pro can be unlocked with your Apple Watch, and not every Apple Watch can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Both devices must meet some requirements before you can adjust your settings to enable this option.

To be able to use your Apple Watch to unlock your phone with the utmost ease, you’ll need:

- An Apple iPhone 14 Pro with Face ID – Apple iPhone 14 Pro X and newer models;
- iOS 14.5 and newer versions;
- An Apple Watch series 3 and newer models;
- watchOS 7.4 and newer versions.

Additional requirements you’ll need to meet include:

- Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and Apple Watch need to be paired;
- Both devices need to have WiFi and Bluetooth turned on (but a connection to a WiFi network isn’t necessary);
- You need to have a passcode on your Apple Watch;
- Wrist detection on your watch needs to be turned on;
- The watch needs to be on your wrist and unlocked.

You’ll also need to wear items such as sunglasses, face coverings, ski masks, or others that prevent you from using your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Face ID.

## Part 3. How To Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro With an Apple Watch

![a cyclist wearing an apple watch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-4.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode;
- **Step 3:** Find and enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**.

Remember that your Apple Watch’s wrist detection must be turned on for this option to work. When you tap to enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**, if your wrist detection isn’t turned on, you’ll get a prompt on your phone asking you to turn it on.

You can turn on wrist detection on your watch by following these steps:

![apple watch wrist detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-6.jpg)

Now that you’ve enabled the option to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro using your Apple Watch, it’s time to simply start using the feature. To unlock your phone, you’ll need to:

- Have your Apple Watch on your wrist, unlocked;
- Tap on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro or raise it to your face to activate it;
- Glance at your phone while wearing a face mask, sunglasses, or another item that’s preventing you from using Face ID;
- Swipe up on your phone’s screen.

Your Apple Watch will send an alert when you’ve used it to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. If you accidentally unlock your phone, simply tap on the **Lock Apple iPhone 14 Pro** on the screen of your watch to lock it.

However, remember that the next time you want to use your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, you’ll first need to type in your passcode.

## Part 4. What To Do if You Can’t Unlock Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro With a Watch

![person wearing face mask unlocking their Apple iPhone 14 Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-7.jpg)

### 1. Check All Settings & Reconfigure

As mentioned earlier, there are a few requirements that your devices need to meet to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro with your Apple Watch.

If you’re using the correct versions of Apple iPhone 14 Pro (iPhone X, iOS 14.5 and newer) and Apple Watch (series 3, watchOS 7.4 and newer), try to reconfigure your settings.

Make sure that you have:

- A passcode on your watch;
- Wrist detection turned on;
- Feature **Unlock with Apple Watch**turned on on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

If all the settings are correct, try one of the following options.

### 2. Restart Your WiFi/Bluetooth Connection

Remember, you only need WiFi and Bluetooth on but don’t need to be connected to a WiFi network.

If the problem persists, you could also restart your devices and try again.

### 3. Reset Your Face ID

In some instances, it’s the Face ID feature that’s causing trouble, so you might want to try and reset it. It’s much easier than it may sound, you just need to follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s **Settings**;
- **Step 2:** Select **Face ID & Passcode**;
- **Step 3:** Tap **Reset Face ID**.

When you tap on this, you’ll need to go through the process of setting your Face ID as usual. You’ll need to type in your passcode, hold your Apple iPhone 14 Pro in front of you (in portrait orientation), tap to get started, and put your face in the provided frame.

Move your face to complete the circle, then tap on **Continue**. Repeat the face scan process the second time and select **Done**.

### 4. Do a System Repair on Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro

If your Apple Watch unlock is still misbehaving, you might need to do a full system repair. As a general rule of thumb, it’s best to use verified apps like Dr.Fone to prevent the problem from getting worse.

### 5. Reset Network Settings

If the problem wasn’t due to a system glitch, you should try resetting your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s network settings. The process is simple, just:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network**;
- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode.

Resetting your network settings will clear out data from your internet, local network, and devices, including WiFi passwords, some Bluetooth connections, and more. However, your paired devices, such as the Apple Watch, shouldn’t be removed.

### 6. Reset Your Watch and Pair It Again

Finally, if you’re still experiencing issues, you might need to reset your Apple Watch and pair it with your Apple iPhone 14 Pro again.

It’s all quite simple:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button;
- **Step 2:** Drag the slider under **Power off**to the right;
- **Step 3:** Press and hold the power button to turn the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device back on.

To perform a hard reset, simultaneously press and hold the power button and digital crown.

## Conclusion

Enabling this option is a straightforward process, and if there’s ever a glitch, there are several options you could try to repair it.

iTunes is one of the most used and innovational software pioneered by Apple. It has proved to be the best software out there through its versatility and exceptional performance. This software is your savior if you’re looking for something to organize your files in iPhone as it has great integration with iOS.

**Step 1: Connect to Computer**

The first step is to connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro to the computer with which you've synced previously.

**Step 2: Recovery Mode and Synchronize**

Now open iTunes. If it asks for a passcode, try another computer that you've synced your device with. Else, put your phone to Recovery mode. Wait for iTunes to detect and sync your device. It will then create a backup.

**Step 4: Restore**

Once your device is synced with iTunes, a "Set Up" window will pop up on the screen displaying two options, "Restore" or "Update." Select "Restore" to proceed further.

### 3.2 Apple iCloud Feature

iCloud is a multifunctional drive compatible with iOS and macOS. It saves your data, your media and organizes your files in folders. Moreover, it allows the user to share media, data, files, and even location with the other iPhone/iOS user. The major feature of Apple iCloud is its ‘Backup’ which stores all your data in case you lose or damage your phone.

To fix the Apple iPhone 14 Pro passcode, which is not working, iCloud can come in handy. But this method can only work if you've logged in to your iCloud account on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and your "Find My iPhone" application is turned on. All you have to do is erase your data which will automatically erase your passcode through iCloud.

**Step 1: Sign in with Apple ID**

First, open iCloud.com on another iOS and write your credentials to sign in your Apple ID.

**Step 2: Select your Device**

Click on "Find My iPhone" and select "All devices," and a list of devices will come up which are working under the same Apple ID. Select your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

If you’ve never synced your Apple iPhone 14 Pro with iTunes or set up “Find my iPhone” and you’re out of options, then iPhone Recovery Mode can come to the rescue. Recovery Mode allows your Apple iPhone 14 Pro to connect with iTunes without restarting the system.
