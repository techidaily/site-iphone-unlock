## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly.

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

## Part 3. Set Up the Apple iPhone 15 device Again Using the Security Lockout Procedure

Security Lockout or “iPhone Unavailable” happens when you attempt a wrong passcode 10 times. From there, you need to erase all your Apple iPhone 15 data to regain access to the iOS device again.

While there is no direct way to regain access to your device when its passcode changes, you will have to [perform a factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) on your Apple iPhone 15 to make it reusable. For that, look through the comprehensive guide on how to take your device out of this state:

- **Step 1.** After getting your iOS 17 device into the "iPhone Unavailable" stage, tap the "Forgot Passcode?" option in the bottom right corner.
- **Step 2.** To start the Apple iPhone 15 reset, you need to tap on the “Start iPhone Reset.” Then, enter your Apple ID password in the given box and sign out your Apple ID. If you have an eSIM, you will be prompted with an option. Select the "Keep eSIM and Erase Data" or the "Delete eSIM and Erase Data" option according to your choice.

In another case, Apple allows you to temporarily sign in to your Apple iPhone 15 using a recently changed passcode within 72 hours. But once you get into your device, set a new passcode immediately to retain your full access.

## Part 4. Using iTunes To Set Up iOS Device Again

iTunes service allows you to reset your Apple iPhone 15 to factory settings and unlock the screen lock if **the Apple iPhone 15 passcode changes on its own**. Using iTunes to set up your Apple iPhone 15 again is a good and safe method, but it removes your device data. If you can compromise losing data, you can follow these instructions to remove the Apple iPhone 15 Passcode Changed Itself issue using iTunes:

**Instructions.** Firstly, launch iTunes on your desktop and connect your Apple iPhone 15. Then, you need to progress into putting your Apple iPhone 15 in the [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263?at=1l3vrSk&ct=3e7454cbe7984ec49e91a8ace8e4198f). Continuing this, iTunes detects your device in Recovery Mode and shows two options: "Update" or "Restore." Click on the "Restore" option and hit the "OK" button to restore your Apple iPhone 15 and regain access.

![restore ios device from itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-7.jpg)

## Part 5. Using iCloud To Set Up iOS Device Again

Using iCloud to unlock iOS devices is a safe and recommended method, but it also leads to complete data loss. If you wish to consider using the iCloud method, it is important for the Find My service to be active on the Apple iPhone 15 device. Also, you need to be aware of your Apple ID and password before proceeding. Follow this comprehensive guide step-by-step to set up your iOS device again using iCloud.

- **Step 1.** First of all, open iCloud on your desktop web browser. Afterward, enter your “Apple ID” and “Password” to proceed. After trusting the Apple iPhone 15 device, look for the "Grid" icon on the top right to find the "Find My" option in the list.

![access find my service from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-8.jpg)

- **Step 2.** After that, choose the Apple iPhone 15 device that you want to recover. Then, click the "Erase This Device" option to remove data and regain your device access.

![erase ios device from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-9.jpg)

## Part 6. Using Find My App To Set Up iOS Device Again

This method needs you to have another iOS device signed into the same Apple ID with the Find My option enabled. After fulfilling these preconditions, you can follow these steps to set up your device whose **iPhone passcode changed from 4 to 6 digits by itself:**

- **Step 1.** Launch the Find My App on any other device, select the "Devices" tab from the bottom menu, find your locked iPhone in the list, and tap on that.
- **Step 2.** You must select the “Erase This Device” button to remove it from the iCloud account. This will instantly factory reset the Apple iPhone 15 device as if it is a new iOS device.
