So, if you need to get things straight, read this detailed guide to go over your issue.

## Part 1: Why Was My iPhone Disabled?

Using a lock screen passcode to secure your iDevice is an excellent way. However, it can become troublesome when you forget the key to your phone. Moreover, you may get stuck even if your screen breaks. On the other hand, someone may take your phone and type a few incorrect passcodes.

If your screen displays "iPhone disabled," the most probable reason is an excess of wrong passcode attempts. However, this can sometimes occur without you understanding if the phone is in your pocket.

It would help if you erased your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to eliminate the lock and passcode, then re-sync it with iTunes. Then, you can restore your phone from an iCloud or an iTunes backup, but if you have never used a backup on your phone, your phone will have nothing.
