### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone SE device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone SE device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone SE device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone SE device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone SE Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone SE locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone SE device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone SE device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone SE device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone SE:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone SE device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone SE:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

![select find my feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone SE from "All Devices." Now choose "Erase iPhone" from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone SE device and remove the Activation Lock.

### Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone SE Locked to Owner

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone SE device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone SE to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.

The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone SE device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone SE Activation Lock:

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone SE is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone SE Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.
- ****Step 2:**** Select "More Wi-Fi Settings" using the "i" symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose "Configure DNS" and follow it by selecting the "Manual" option.
- ****Step 3:**** Afterward, press "Add Server," located under "DNS Servers." Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:

- For users in the United States/North America: 104.154.51.7
- For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90
- For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58
- For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60

![use the dns method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg)

- ****Step 4:**** Save the changes by selecting "Save." Use the back arrow button to go back and choose "Ask to Join Networks." Enter the network password and tap "Join." Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone SE attempts to activate. Afterward, continue to set up your Apple iPhone SE.

### Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service

What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn't working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone SE. All you need to provide them is your Apple iPhone SE IMEI number. The process is done remotely and takes 24 to 48 hours to complete.

Ensure your device IMEI is not blacklisted before sending it for the unlocking process. Described below are steps to use [<u>DirectUnlocks</u>](https://directunlocks.com/en_us/icloud-unlock), an iCloud Activation removal service:

- ****Step 1:**** Use your computer's browser to visit the official DriectUnlocks website. Enter your Apple iPhone SE's IMEI number and select the Apple iPhone SE model in the provided box.
- ****Step 2:**** Once you have entered the details, tap "Remove Activation Lock." Afterward, select a payment method to pay for the service. It will take up to 48 hours to unlock your device.
