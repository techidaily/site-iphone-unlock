[Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) specializes in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock.

It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions.

Its remarkable performance includes the permanent bypass of the Apple ID lock.

### Notable Characteristics of Wondershare Dr.Fone

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro from the Apple iPhone 11 Pro devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro and return the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 11 Pro easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 11 Pro again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.
