_Apple iPhone 8 Plus Disabled?_

Because of using face masks, [Face ID](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone-13.html) on iPhone does not always work correctly, and we are entering our passcodes more than before. If we enter it incorrectly a few times in succession, the phone will disable itself to prevent unauthorized access. It can seem like the end of the world because in so many ways smartphones have become our world. Here are ways you can unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus disabled due to too many incorrect passcode attempts.

Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus will be unlocked in a short span of time. Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device.

## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 8 Plus) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![restore iphone to factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

When the Apple iPhone 8 Plus reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)

Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn't require going through complex hoops.

Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

![icloud find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus remotely and your Apple iPhone 8 Plus will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 8 Plus once again.

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus and return the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 8 Plus is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 8 Plus easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 8 Plus again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

## Forgot Apple iPhone 8 Plus Backup Password? Here's What to Do

Forgetting your Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can't access your data, but it also means you can't restore your phone if something goes wrong.

There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you're having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup password, don't despair. There are still ways to get it back!

![forget backup password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 8 Plus is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password

### 1\. Try all passwords you used on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus

The typical method that each individual attempts for the first time is to input all of the available passcodes. Even if it is the most straightforward technique, there is still a possibility that you miss one of them. Therefore, think about all of the passwords you may input, which are listed below.

- The password to log in to the computer
- The password to access Apple ID
- The password to access the encrypted data on the hard disk
- The password to access various websites
- The password to log in to the computer
- Password for the wireless network
- Password for the email account
- Passcode for the administrator
- Passcode for the iPhone

### 2\. "Reset All Settings" via "Settings"

To begin, go to the **Settings** app on your iOS device, then choose **General**, followed by **Reset.**

![reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-3.jpg)

You may now go to **Reset All Settings** and confirm by entering the security passcode when prompted. Then, your phone will automatically go through the process of resetting and returning to its default settings.

You can also get rid of the password for the last backup without deleting any other apps or data.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-4.jpg)

Use a USB cable to link your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to your PC. Look at the small iOS icon in the figure below. Just click on it.

![backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-5.jpg)

Proceed to the **Summary Page** and make your selection there for **The Computer.** After selecting **Encrypt Local Backup**, you must create a new password. After you have pressed the **Backup Now** option, wait for iTunes to create a new password for you.

### 3\. Find your password in the macOS keychain

**Step 1:** Launch Keychain Access by going to **Application** \> **Utilities** \> **Keychain Access** once your Mac has booted up.

**Step 2:** Check for a backup of your Apple iPhone 8 Plus by entering it into the search box and looking for it there.

**Step 3:** Double-click the **Show Password** option, and then choose it from the drop-down menu. After that, type in the password for the keychain. At long last, the password for your Apple iPhone 8 Plus backup will be shown.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-6.jpg)

### 4\. Select "Back Up Now" via iCloud to remove password

If you already have a backup stored in iCloud, you may use iCloud for recovery.

First, power up the gadget and look for the "Hello" screen. If you have previously set up your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, you must delete or remove all of the material before continuing.

Navigate to the **Apps & Data menu** and choose the **Restore from iCloud Backup** option.

After successfully signing in with your Apple ID, choose **Backup**.

![restore from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-7.jpg)

During the time that the system is being restored, it is essential that the Wi-Fi connection remains active.

### 5\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

With Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, it's easy to follow all the steps to get rid of the iTunes backup password.

**Step 1:** After installing Dr.Fone, open it and look for the red **Screen Unlock** button.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2:** In the Screen Unlock interface, tap **Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption** in the bottom right corner to move forward.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3:** When you get to this page, use a USB cable to connect your iOS device to the PC. If Dr.Fone can find this connection, you will see the picture below.

Before you click **Remove Now**, please carefully read the following three notes:

- Make sure to turn off **Find My iPhone**.
- Don't open iTunes while doing this.
- Your device will reboot

![connected](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone can check your iTunes backup and delete it by itself. This encryption will be erased when the progress bar reaches 100%. This will take a short time to do.

![checking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png)

**Step 5:** The encryption on the iTunes backup has been removed successfully! Now you can easily back up, restore, move, or wipe your device.

![removed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png)


## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 8 Plus will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!

Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.

### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 8 Plus without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

![touch id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-5.jpg)

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.
