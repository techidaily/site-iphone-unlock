### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 6s passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 6s in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 6s device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 6s passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 6s, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 6s to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 6s.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 6s to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 6s and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 6s and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone 6s device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 6s cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 6s passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 6s passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 6s.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

![use siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg)

As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.

### 5\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock
