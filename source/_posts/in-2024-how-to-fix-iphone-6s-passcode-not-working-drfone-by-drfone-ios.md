But be sure that iTunes version installed over your computer is up to date or else unknown errors may crop up in between. Eventually, your all-new Apple iPhone 6s may even get bricked.

## Part 5. How about Apple iPhone 6s restrictions passcode?

Apple iPhone 6s restrictions is a vital setting that is used to lock down a set of functions of the iPhone. These iPhone restrictions are also known as Parental Controls. That implies one can make use of these settings to block or hide songs that have explicit lyrics/content or barring YouTube from running, etc.

Now, if you somehow forgot the passcode that was set to make use of iPhone restrictions, you need to restore your Apple iPhone 6s with the help of iTunes to remove the previous passcode. But ensure not to restore an old backup of iPhone or else, the old passcode which you may not know will also get activated. Eventually, making your situation even worse.
