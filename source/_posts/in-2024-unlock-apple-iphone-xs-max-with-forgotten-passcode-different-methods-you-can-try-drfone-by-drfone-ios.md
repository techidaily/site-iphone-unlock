## Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode

Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we'll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.

### 1\. Use Find My iPhone

- **Step 2:** Select "All Devices" at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone XS Max from the list of devices.
- **Step 3:** Click "Erase iPhone" and confirm that you want to erase your device.

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you've synced your Apple iPhone XS Max with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone XS Max, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.

Just go with the steps below.

- **Step 1:** To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone XS Max to a computer and turn on iTunes.
- **Step 2:** While your Apple iPhone XS Max is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.

### 3\. Use Siri

If you're running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn't work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it's not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.

![siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg)

Just follow the instructions.

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"
- **Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock".
- **Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

While this method doesn't give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device's features.

## Part 1: Why iPhone is Saying Passcode is Wrong?

If you enter the wrong password, your Apple iPhone XS Max will not accept it and won’t open your phone. If you repeatedly enter the wrong password, it will disable your phone mainly because of security reasons. However, sometimes you’re genuinely trying to enter the correct password, but your device won’t accept it. This isn't common, but there are quite a few reasons why iPhone is saying your passcode is wrong.

Sometimes the problem is trivial, like you may have entered the wrong keys in a hurry, due to which it won't accept your passcode. In other cases, face recognition may not recognize your face if you're wearing any mask.

However, occasionally the problem is technical. Sometimes, your Apple iPhone XS Max may be corrupted. This can cause trouble for your device to detect the security file where your passcode is stored. Other times, the operating system may not be installed properly after updating to the new version of iOS.
