- **Step 1.** You begin by accessing your iDevice‚Äôs ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù app and scrolling down to tap the "Mail" option. Next, press "Accounts," and on the following screen, select the Outlook account.

![head to mail accounts in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-2.jpg)

### Fix 2. Change the Password to Your Outlook Mail

Sometimes, the email service provider may force users to change their passwords for security reasons. There is a chance that it is why your **iPhone asks for an Outlook password**. To modify your Outlook password from the desktop platform, adhere to the following steps:

- **Step 1.** Open your preferred web browser and go to the Outlook login page. Sign in to your Outlook account, locate, and click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner. There, click "My Profile," and on the next screen, tap "Change Password" near the upper right corner.

![access my profile outlook web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-4.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Upon reaching the verification page, provide your password and tap the "Sign In" button. Afterward, you will be asked for other verification methods. Upon verifying, the "Change your password" window will appear. Here, you will need to enter your "Current password," "New password," and re-enter it to proceed. Then, hit the "Save" button, and your password will be changed.

### Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection

[<u>Network inconsistencies</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html) can often disrupt the authentication process. This can be the leading cause behind persistent password prompts. To ensure a stable connection, ensure that you are connected to a reliable and stable Wi-Fi network. You can also try toggling the Wi-Fi and mobile data switches on and off.

Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.

### Fix 4. Using the Mail Toggle as a Remedy

A strategic approach to resolving authentication issues involves using the Mail toggle. You can use it to disable and re-enable the email services. This action essentially resets the Outlook app's connection and can be performed as follows:

- **Step 1.** Within your Apple iPhone SE (2020)'s "Settings" app, scroll down and tap "Mail." On the following screen, press "Accounts" and choose the "Outlook" account.

### Fix 9. Try Other Alternatives to Outlook

Exploring alternative mail applications may offer a viable workaround. This is especially true if the **iPhone asking for the Outlook password** proves resistant to previous solutions. Consider using other email platforms such as Apple Mail, [<u>Gmail</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-gmail-phone-verification.html), and Yahoo Mail.
