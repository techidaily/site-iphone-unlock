As you can see, in all the above-stated solutions, your Apple iPhone 7 data would be lost. Therefore, we recommend trying this technique beforehand. For iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1 versions, it has been observed that Siri has a loophole which can be exploited to unlock the iOS device. It might be a little tricky and doesn’t provide guaranteed results. Nevertheless, you can give it a try and learn how to unlock iPhone 6 without a password by following these steps:

1\. Unlock your Apple iPhone 7 and press the Home button to activate Siri.

2\. Provide a command like “What time is it” to get the current time with the display of the clock icon.

4\. Here, you need to add another clock. Tap on the “+” icon to do it.
