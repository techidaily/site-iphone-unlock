## How to Unlock Apple iPhone X, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone X. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone X with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone X is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone X Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone X is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone X from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone X, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone X and entered it incorrectly a few times.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone X does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone X without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone X:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone X without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.
