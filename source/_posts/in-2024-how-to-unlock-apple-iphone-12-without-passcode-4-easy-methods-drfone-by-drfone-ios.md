## 5 Easy Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 without Passcode by Yourself

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the Find My iPhone function, then you can try it to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![use find My Apple iPhone 12 to unlock iphone 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 4:** Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone 12 from the list of devices.

**Step 5:** Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.

**Step 6:** Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 12:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 12:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 4:** On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.

## Part 3. \[All Data Lost\] Trying Recovery Mode for Unlocking Stolen iPhone

Another lifesaver method to unlock stolen iPhones is by utilizing the Recovery Mode. For this purpose, users need to connect their iPhones to their PC using [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/). Its ability to facilitate data restoration makes it an effective method to unlock iOS devices. Rather than searching for “**I bought a lost iPhone how do I unlock it**,” simply follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1.** Connect your locked stolen Apple iPhone 12 to the computer using a USB cable. To enter the Recovery Mode, you need to follow the steps below, depending on your Apple iPhone 12 model:

- **For iPhone 8 and Later:** Press and release the "Volume Up" button, followed by the "Volume Down" button. Press and hold the "Side" button on the right side of the Apple iPhone 12 device to activate Recovery Mode.
- **For iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:** Press and hold the "Volume Down" and "Side/Power" buttons to enable Recovery Mode in iPhone 7 models.
- **For iPhone 6 and Earlier:** To activate Recovery Mode, press and hold the "Home" and "Side/Power" buttons until the respective screen displays.

- **Step 2:** Once your Apple iPhone 12 is in Recovery Mode, iTunes will detect it automatically. A pop-up window will appear within iTunes to detect some problems with the Apple iPhone 12 device. Tap the "Restore" button to start the process and unlock your Apple iPhone 12 by erasing all settings and content.

## Part 4. Using Third-Party Unlocking Service To Unlock Stolen iPhone

In certain scenarios, when an iPhone gets stolen, it might enable the “Activation Lock.” This usually occurs to prevent the unauthorized access and usage of the Apple iPhone 12 device. When you face such a situation, third-party unlocking services can help you bypass the Activation Lock.

These services include [IMEIUnlockSIM](https://www.imeiunlocksim.com/unlock-phone/icloud-activation-lock-removal-services/), [IMEICHECK.CO](https://imeicheck.co/product/icloud-removal/) and [Apple iPhone Unlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/en_gb). Below, we have outlined steps for using Apple iPhone Unlock to help you with **how do I unlock a stolen iPhone** issue:

**Instructions:** First, access the Apple iPhone Unlock official website and enter the IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 12 device. Select the particular iOS device model and continue to select “Remove Activation Lock.” Following this, review the order summary and pay the fee with the required option. Upon successful completion of payment, the service will contact you for instant unlocking within 24 hours.
