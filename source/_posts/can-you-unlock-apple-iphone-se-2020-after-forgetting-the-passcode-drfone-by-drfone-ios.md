### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone SE (2020) passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone SE (2020) in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device.

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone SE (2020), iPad, or iPod Contact.**
