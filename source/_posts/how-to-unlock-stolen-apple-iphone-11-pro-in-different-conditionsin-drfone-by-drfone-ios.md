## Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?

Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, it's crucial to understand, "**What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone**?" While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you'll learn both aspects.

Benefits of Jailbreaking

Apple's App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro:

- **Install Unapproved Apps**

Apple's App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.

- **Increased Customization Options**

Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg)

- **Unlocking System-wide Features**

Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren't in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 11 Pro based on your preferences.

- **Unlocking Network Restrictions**

Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 11 Pro from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.

However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.

Risks of Jailbreaking

While jailbreaking itself isn't illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple's security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**

Bypassing Apple's security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.

- **Voided Warranty**

Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won't cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.

- **Instability and Performance Issues**

Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in [<u>crashes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html), [<u>freezes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html), or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 11 Pro's performance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![iphone apps crashing message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg)

- **Difficulty in Updating**

Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.

- **Bricking Risk**

Incorrect jailbreaking can "[<u>brick</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html)" your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.

## Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?

Jailbreaking an iPhone won't remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device's system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here's how they differ:

- **Jailbreak**

**If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, what happens** is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.

- **iCloud Activation Lock**

iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 11 Pro to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.

![icloud activation lock on an iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg)

While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can't override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/), leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.

## Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password

Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering "**What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone**?"

Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you've forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner's details.

To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It's user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.

Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:
