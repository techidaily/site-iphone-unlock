If the new Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max 13, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max 14, and now the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max 15.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.
