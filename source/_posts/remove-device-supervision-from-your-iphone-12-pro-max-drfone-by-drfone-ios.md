![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-1.png)

When you reach this screen, connect your iOS device to your computer using a USB connection. If Dr.Fone can identify this link, the graphic below will display.

Before choosing "Remove Now," please read the 3 notes carefully:

- Verify that "Find My iPhone" is disabled.
- Do not launch "iTunes" at this time.
- Your device will reboot in the process of deleting

![connected device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

Dr.Fone can automatically verify your iTunes backup and erase it. Once the progress indicator reaches 100 percent, this encryption will be removed. This procedure will not need much time.

**Step 5:** The iTunes backup encryption now disappears! You may use your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max freely.
