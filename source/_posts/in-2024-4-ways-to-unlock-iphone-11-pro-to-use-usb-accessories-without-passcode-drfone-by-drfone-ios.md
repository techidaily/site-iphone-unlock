It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only. Simply put, when your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is locked for more than an hour, it needs to be unlocked to allow the connection of USB accessories. Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

To check whether your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.

However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.
