This might be new to you, but there are a few forensic toolkits in the market that can help you perform Apple iPhone SE bypass without much trouble. One of the most reliable options is the Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit. Though, in order to use it, you need to download [its licensed version](https://www.elcomsoft.com/) from its website right.

Later, you can simply connect your phone to the system and run the forensic tool. From the welcome screen, select the option of “Get Passcode”. This will run an encrypted command and provide a passcode to your phone that can be used to unlock it.
