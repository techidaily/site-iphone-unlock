Step 5: Follow the on-screen instructions to boot the Apple iPhone XS Max in Recovery Mode. If for some reason you are unable to boot into Recovery Mode, there are instructions at the bottom to enter DFU mode.

Step 7: Select the firmware package after the download completes. After the download completes, you can click Unlock Now to start unlocking the Apple iPhone XS Max.

In a short while, your Apple iPhone XS Max will be unlocked. It is important to note that unlocking a locked Apple iPhone XS Max cannot be done without wiping data.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone XS Max with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone XS Max device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone XS Max, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone XS Max.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone XS Max and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone XS Max and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone XS Max was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone XS Max in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone XS Max to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone XS Max and unlock Apple iPhone XS Max.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone XS Max

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone XS Max, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone XS Max:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

![turn passcode off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone XS Max leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone XS Max itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone XS Max device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone XS Max/Apple iPhone XS Max mini/Apple iPhone XS Max Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone XS Max now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone XS Max range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone XS Max range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone XS Max range builds on the Apple iPhone XS Max 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone XS Max 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone XS Max lineup. the Apple iPhone XS Max lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone XS Max lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone XS Max mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone XS Max models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone XS Max models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone XS Max mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone XS Max 12 mini was.
