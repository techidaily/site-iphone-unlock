### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 15 Plus in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 15 Plus cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.
