### To Do List #2. Make an Insurance Claim With AppleCare

You can claim insurance if you have AppleCare+ coverage for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss for iPhone includes protection against theft and loss incidents. It offers up to two incidents of such coverage every 12 months.

To qualify for theft or loss coverage, it is necessary for Find My to be enabled on your device at the time it goes missing. Moreover, it should remain enabled alongside Lost Mode throughout the claims process.
