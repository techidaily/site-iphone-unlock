### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

So, if you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max passcode and are looking for how to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max without passcode, use this guide to pick one of the three easy ways to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max in case of forgotten passcode.

For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple.

![find my on macos ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and return the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you‚Äôre more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone ‚Äì Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.
