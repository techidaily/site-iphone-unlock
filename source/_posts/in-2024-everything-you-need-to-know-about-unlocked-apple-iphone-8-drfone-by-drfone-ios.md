After going to the DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the information about your Apple iPhone 8. From the following screen, confirm your phone model and iOS version. If it is isn't correctly given, select the correct data pair from the drop-down menu. Then download the firmware package for your Apple iPhone 8.
