## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

- **Step 1.** Firstly, open your Apple iPhone 15 Plus "Settings" and tap the "General" option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.
