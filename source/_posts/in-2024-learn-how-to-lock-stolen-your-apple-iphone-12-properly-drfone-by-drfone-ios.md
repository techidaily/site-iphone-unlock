### Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection

[<u>Network inconsistencies</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html) can often disrupt the authentication process. This can be the leading cause behind persistent password prompts. To ensure a stable connection, ensure that you are connected to a reliable and stable Wi-Fi network. You can also try toggling the Wi-Fi and mobile data switches on and off.

Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.
