**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.
