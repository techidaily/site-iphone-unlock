## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![restore iphone to factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)

Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn't require going through complex hoops.

Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

![icloud find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max remotely and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max once again.

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and return the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max

Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

![select find my feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from "All Devices." Now choose "Erase iPhone" from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and remove the Activation Lock.

![tap on erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg)

### Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Locked to Owner

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.
- ****Step 2:**** Select "More Wi-Fi Settings" using the "i" symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose "Configure DNS" and follow it by selecting the "Manual" option.
- ****Step 3:**** Afterward, press "Add Server," located under "DNS Servers." Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:

- For users in the United States/North America: 104.154.51.7
- For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90
- For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58
- For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60
