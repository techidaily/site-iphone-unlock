Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone XS, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone XS.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone XS and click Erase iPhone and confirm.
