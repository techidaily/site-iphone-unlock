So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone XS with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone XS is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone XS Locked?

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone XS does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone XS

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone XS, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone XS:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone XS leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone XS itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone XS device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone XS/Apple iPhone XS mini/Apple iPhone XS Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone XS now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone XS range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone XS range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone XS range builds on the Apple iPhone XS 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone XS 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone XS lineup. the Apple iPhone XS lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone XS lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone XS mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone XS models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone XS models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone XS mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone XS 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone XS is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone XS and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone XS. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone XS for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone XS and unlocking it.
