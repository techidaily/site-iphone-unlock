Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 14 Plus 15.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics.
