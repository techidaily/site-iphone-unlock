Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 12 Pro itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
