## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 14 Pro passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

Follow the steps to do this.

2. Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.
3. Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone 14 Pro's specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named **Restore iPhone**.
4. By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro XR lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone

### Method #3: Remove Passcode With Tapping Erase Phone (iOS 15.2 only)
