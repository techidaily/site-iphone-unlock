Therefore, if you don’t want your Apple iPhone 13 mini and iPad to be misused by thieves, you should take some added measures. Follow these suggestions to increase security on your iOS device.

1\. Disable Siri from the lock screen

If someone can’t access Siri from the lock screen, then they won’t be able to follow the above-mentioned process to unlock an iOS device. Therefore, it is highly recommended to disable Siri from the lock screen. To do this, visit your device’s Settings > Touch ID & Passcode, and under the “Allow access when locked” section, disable the option of “Siri.”

2\. Enable Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini service

There are times when users forget to enable the Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini feature on their iOS device. To access this feature, make sure that it is turned on. To do this, go to your device’s Settings > iCloud > Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini and turn on the feature of “Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini.” Additionally, you should turn on the “Send the last location” option as well.
