### How do you fix an unresponsive lock screen on iPhone running on iOS 17?

If your lock screen is unresponsive on iPhone running on iOS 17, you can try force restarting your device. To do this, you need to press and hold the Home button and Sleep/Wake button simultaneously for 10 seconds.

After that, release the Sleep/Wake button but keep holding the Home button until you see the Apple logo. Once your device is restarted, check if the problem persists or not.

If the problem still bothers you, you can try using a third-party tool like Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock to reset the phone, eventually fixing the issue.
