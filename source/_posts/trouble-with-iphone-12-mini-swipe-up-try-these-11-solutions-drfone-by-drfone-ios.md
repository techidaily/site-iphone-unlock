Did you go wrong when you set the Face ID the first time? Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini? And now, you want to disable the Face ID.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 12 mini 13, the Apple iPhone 12 mini 14, and now the Apple iPhone 12 mini 15.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.
