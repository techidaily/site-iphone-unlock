Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn **how to remove Face ID** on your Apple iPhone 6s X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.

## Part I: What is Face ID?

![face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

If the new Apple iPhone 6s is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 6s from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 6s 13, the Apple iPhone 6s 14, and now the Apple iPhone 6s 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 6s 13/12/11 with Face ID:

### II.I Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6s

As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to [unlock your Apple iPhone 6s 13](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-an-iphone-13.html)/iPhone 12/iPhone 11 with a look. How to do that? Here are the steps:

Step 1: Pick your Apple iPhone 6s up in your hands or tap the screen to wake it up.

Step 2: Look at the iPhone.

![unlocking iphone 13 with face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-2.jpg)

When the lock symbol changes to the unlocked position, you can swipe up to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s using Face ID and get to the Home Screen.

Note that Face ID will not work in landscape mode on an iPhone.

### II.II Making Purchases Using Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 6s

Face ID allows you to authenticate yourself to make purchases in the App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store and use Apple Pay wherever supported.

#### How to use Face ID on Apple iPhone 6s to make purchases in App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store

Step 1: Check if Face ID is enabled for purchases in these stores by going to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and ensuring that iTunes and App Store are toggled On.

![check face id settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

Step 2: On any of these stores, when you tap on the option to buy some content, a payment confirmation popup will be displayed along with instructions to authenticate yourself using Face ID.

![make purchases with face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg)

The instructions are simple: press the side button twice to authenticate yourself using your Face ID and make the purchase.

When done, a satisfying ting and a checkmark will confirm the action.

#### How to use Face ID on Apple iPhone 6s to pay with Apple Pay

Step 1: If Apple Pay is supported by banking institutions in your country, you can set it up by adding a supported bank‘s credit card, debit card, or prepaid card to the Wallet app on your Apple iPhone 6s 13/12/11.

![an apple aard in wallet app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg)

Step 2: When a card is added and ready to use, check that Apple Pay is enabled under Settings > Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: For App Store/ Book Store/ iTunes Store purchases, it works as always, you double-press the Side Button to authenticate and use your default card.

Step 4: Look at your Apple iPhone 6s to authenticate yourself using your Face ID and make the purchase.

Step 6: To pay using Apple Pay on websites, choose Apple Pay as the payment method, double press the Side Button, look at your Apple iPhone 6s, and wait for the Done message and checkmark to finish the process.

### II.III Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically

Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.

![attention aware features](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and passcode.

Step 2: Toggle Require Attention For Face ID On.

Step 3: Toggle Attention Aware Features On.

That‘s it. Now, when you get a call and your Apple iPhone 6s 13 is ringing loud, looking at your Apple iPhone 6s 13/12/11 will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your Apple iPhone 6s. Additionally, your Apple iPhone 6s screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.

### II.IV Filling Passwords in Safari Automatically Using Face ID

Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your Apple iPhone 6s with Face ID.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.

Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.

Step 3: Look at your Apple iPhone 6s to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### II.V Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 6s X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 6s and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 13/12/11:

Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.

Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji/ Memoji you want to send.

## Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 6s

For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.

Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s 13/12/11 and set it again if you have put on some 'COVID weight' owing to working from home.

To restart your Apple iPhone 6s 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 6s device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 6s 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

## Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 6s

Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.

Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 6s in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

![setting up face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg)

Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.

In case you are getting the following error:

![face id error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg)
