All Apple iPhone X models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone X mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone X 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone X is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone X and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone X. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone X for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone X and unlocking it.
