Step 7: Select the firmware package after the download completes. After the download completes, you can click Unlock Now to start unlocking the Apple iPhone X.

In a short while, your Apple iPhone X will be unlocked. It is important to note that unlocking a locked Apple iPhone X cannot be done without wiping data.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone X with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone X remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone X, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone X device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone X, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone X.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone X and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone X and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone X was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone X in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone X using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone X to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone X and unlock Apple iPhone X.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone X

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone X, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone X:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone X leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone X itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone X device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone X/Apple iPhone X mini/Apple iPhone X Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone X now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone X range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone X range that you may never know before.

You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone X lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone X mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone X models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone X models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone X mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone X 12 mini was.
