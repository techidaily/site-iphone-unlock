**Why do Users like it? (Review)**

It is possible to retrieve forgotten iTunes backup passwords with this Free iPhone backup unlocker, even if the passwords were lost due to a computer breakdown or because the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max was misplaced or stole

**Pros**

- Free tool

**Cons**

- Not user-friendly

### The Bottom Line

I have high hopes that this list will enable you to get the very finest iPhone backup Unlocker Software. This list is vetted and narrowed down to include just those items with advanced features and outstanding performance.

All of the software that was described is accessible for both Mac and Windows operating systems, and some of it even has a trial version that you can use to test it out. However, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is the ideal option as an iPhone backup unlocker you should try first!
