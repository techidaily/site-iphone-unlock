- Disconnect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, then, at that point, turn it on and set it up. That's all you need to do.

### 2\. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud

Apple allows clients to erase iPhone data to safeguard it from others remotely. However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don't erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 13 Pro will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

**Step 4.** Click the "Erase iPhone" button. Subsequently, set up the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and set another lock screen PIN. With iCloud, you can unlock your iDevice without even touching your device.

![icloud unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-3.jpg)

### 3\. Unlock it with iTunes

Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 13 Pro in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.

Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.

Additionally, ensure that you keep your iDevices' Apple ID details safe. Else, you will not have the option to use the iDevice again. Using iTunes will erase the screen's password but not the firmware. Considering that, you must keep the information in mind to set up and utilize the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device.

**Step 1. Go to Recovery mode**

**On iPhone 8/8 Or more and Above:** Hold the power/side button and press any of the volume buttons until a slider appears. Move the slider to turn off the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device shows the recovery mode screen.

**On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the power off slider. Next, move the slider to turn off the iPhone. Then, press the Volume (-) button and connect the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.**

After you connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the "Your iPhone name" and ask you to restore it. In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn't run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.
