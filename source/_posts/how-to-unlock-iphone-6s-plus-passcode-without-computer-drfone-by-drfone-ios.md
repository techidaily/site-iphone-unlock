## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone 6s Plus

Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone 6s Plus locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 6s Plus:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

But if you want your Apple iPhone 6s Plus set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:

![hard reset iphone 6 while locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/factory-reset-locked-iphone-without-itunes-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the " Sleep/Wake " button and the " Home " button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.

**Step 2:** After 10 seconds have passed, release the " Sleep/Wake " button but keep holding the " Home " button.

**Step 3:** Keep holding the " Home " button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

**Step 4:** Here, you will be in recovery mode, and now you can reset your Apple iPhone 6s Plus.

Your device will now be reset, and you will have a phone like a new one.

### 5\. How can I get into a locked iPhone?

If you have lost the passcode of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, then you can use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool to factory reset your device. To do this, you need to proceed with the steps given above. They are easy to follow and will help you reset your device without risk.
