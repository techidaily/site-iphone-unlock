## Part 2: How to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode with Siri? (iOS 8.0 – iOS 10.1)

If you are an avid user of Apple products, then the chances are that you must have already heard of this Apple iPhone 11 hack. If you are running a device on iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1, then you can take the assistance of Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 lock. Even though this is not a secure way to surpass your phone’s lock screen, it doesn’t restore or erase your data in the process. You can follow these steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode with Siri.

**Step 1**. Firstly, hold the Home button on our phone to activate Siri. Speak a command like “Siri, what time is it?” to ask the present time. Now, tap on the clock icon.

**Step 2.** It will open an interface for the world clock feature. From here, add another clock.

## Part 3: How to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode with iTunes?

Another popular way to restore your Apple iPhone 11 is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Needless to say, even though you would be able to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode, the technique will wipe the data on your device. Though, if you have already taken a backup of your data, then you can choose to restore it after performing an Apple iPhone 11 bypass. Do it by following these instructions.

**Step 1.** Launch iTunes on your system and connect it with a USB/lightning cable.

**Step 2.** Hold the Home button on your Apple iPhone 11 and while pressing it, connect it to your system. This will display a connect-to-iTunes symbol.

![connect to itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14993663711652.jpg "connect to itunes")

**Step 3.** After connecting your phone to the system, iTunes will automatically recognize it and display the following message. Simply click on the “Restore” button.
