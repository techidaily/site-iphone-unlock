If the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits the recovery mode screen, let the download finish, turn off your Apple iPhone 15, and start again.

- **Step 2.** Switch off your Apple iPhone 15 and press and hold the Home and the Side/Power button for 10 seconds.
- **Step 3.** Release the Side/Power button, but continue to hold the Home button until iTunes recognizes your Apple iPhone 15 in recovery mode.
- **Step 4.** When your iDevice is in recovery mode, you can use iTunes to restore your Apple iPhone 15 and bypass the passcode.

Remember that using DFU mode to bypass your Apple iPhone 15 passcode will erase all data from your device.
