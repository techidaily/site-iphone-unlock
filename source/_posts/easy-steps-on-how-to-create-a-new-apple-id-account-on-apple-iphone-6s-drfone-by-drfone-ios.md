You might need to create a new Apple ID to enhance your Apple experience. Let's dive into why it's a good idea:

### A. Reasons for Creating a New Apple ID Account

- Your Apple ID is like your digital identity. Creating a new one lets you choose a unique email address that suits you, adding a personal touch to your Apple journey.
- Maybe you've been using an email for your Apple ID that you don't want to use anymore. Creating a new one helps keep your personal and Apple-related emails separate.
- **Switching Devices.**When you switch to a new Apple device, like getting a new iPhone or iPad, creating a unique Apple ID ensures a fresh start tailored to your new gadget.
- **Separation of Accounts.**Sometimes, you may want to keep your work-related apps and data separate from your ones. Creating a new Apple ID helps you achieve this separation.
- If you're using Apple services for different purposes, such as work and personal use, having separate Apple IDs can help keep everything organized and distinct.

- **New Apple Device.**When you purchase a new Apple device, like an iPhone or iPad, you'll need a new Apple ID to set it up and make it truly yours.
- **Shared Device.**If multiple people use the same device, creating a new Apple ID for each user ensures that everyone has their own personalized experience.
- **Change of Email.**If your current email address associated with your Apple ID is changed or you prefer a new one, creating a unique Apple ID with the updated email is the solution.
- **Work and Personal.**To keep your work-related apps and data separate from your personal ones, having separate Apple IDs for each purpose is practical and organized.
- **Starting Fresh.**Sometimes, you might want a fresh start with your Apple experience, and creating a new Apple ID provides a clean slate.

### C. Setting Up Security Questions

The next process will be setting up security questions for your account:

- **Step 6:** Apple asks you to choose and answer security questions. These questions provide an additional layer of protection for your account. Select questions that you can easily remember and that others can't guess.

### D. Finalizing the Process

To finalize the creation process, refer to the steps given below:

- **Step 7:** Read through Apple's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. Once you've understood them, tick the box to confirm that you've read and agree to the iCloud and Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. Then click **Agree** to proceed.

Here are ways you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6s disabled due to too many incorrect passcode attempts.

## Part 1: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Without iTunes/ iCloud Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)

## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 6s to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 6s and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 6s) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![restore iphone to factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 6s and unlock your Apple iPhone 6s.

When the Apple iPhone 6s reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)

Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn't require going through complex hoops.

Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 6s, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 6s.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 6s.

![icloud find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 6s remotely and your Apple iPhone 6s will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 6s once again.

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 6s.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 6s from the Apple iPhone 6s devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 6s and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6s Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6s with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6s and return the Apple iPhone 6s device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6s is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 6s with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 6s easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 6s again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 6s disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 6s device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

## Can You Unlock Apple iPhone 6s After Forgetting the Passcode?

## Part 1: Can I Unlock My iPhone When I Forgot Passcode?

Yes, you can unlock your locked iPhone without a passcode. If you **forgot passcode on iPhone**, Apple's proper prescribed way is to reset your Apple iPhone 6s. In other words, do a factory reset to erase the passcode. However, many individuals can't do this strategy since it's irksome and may lead to a few unforeseen issues. Such issues can worsen the condition.

Therefore, we have introduced some alternate ways to unlock your iDevice. You can even use an expert tool to remove this issue. Keep following us to find out more about our recommended methods.

### 1\. Use Find My

![find my](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-1.jpg)

### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 6s passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 6s in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 6s device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 6s passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 6s, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 6s to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 6s transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 6s to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 6s.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 6s to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 6s and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

![itunes unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-2.jpg)

### 3\. "Erase iPhone" Option

However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone 6s device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 6s and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone 6s device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 6s cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.
