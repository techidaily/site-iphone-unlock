### What is an iPhone backup password?

A passcode encrypts your Apple iPhone 7 Plus's backups, allowing only you to access them. This passcode is referred to as an iPhone backup password.

![itunes password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-unlocker-2.jpg)

If you do not remember your password, you cannot view any data in your backup or restore it.

A few methods allow you to guess or brute-force your way into the password. Still, the most reliable method to unlock your backup is to use a professional tool such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, Passfab iPhone Backup Unlocker, or other iPhone backup unlockers. This group of software employs a sophisticated algorithm to figure out your password for you, and it has a high percentage of success.

Additionally, it is simple and can be finished in minutes rather than hours.

An iPhone backup unlocker is software that, if you forget the password for your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, may assist you in regaining access to your device.

A brute-force assault is the most popular strategy for accomplishing this goal, while many other approaches may also work. To do this, one must iterate through every conceivable combination of letters and digits until one reaches the proper passcode.
