## Part 4: How to get into a locked Apple iPhone XR with Siri?

If you don’t want to erase your device’s data while resolving this issue, you can use Siri. You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone XR by implementing the following steps:

**Step 1.** To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.

**Step 2.** On the world clock interface, add another clock.

**Step 3.** The interface will ask you to search for a location of your choice. Type anything on the search tab and select it to get various options. Tap on the “Select all” text.

**Step 4.** A few added options will be displayed. Tap on “Share” to proceed.

**Step 5.** Out of all the options to share this text, select the Message app.

**Step 6.** A new interface will be opened from where you can draft a new message. Type anything in the “To” field and tap "return" from a keyboard.

**Step 9.** Instead of adding a contact, tap on the photo icon and select the “Choose Photo” option.

![choose photo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492748614.jpg "choose photo")

**Step 10.** This will open the photo library on your phone. Visit an album or wait for a while.

**Step 11.** Now, press the home button. If nothing goes wrong, then you will enter the Home screen on your phone.
