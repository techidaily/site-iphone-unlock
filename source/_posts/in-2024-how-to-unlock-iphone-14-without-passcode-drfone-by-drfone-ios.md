## How To Change Your Apple ID Password On your Apple iPhone 14

Are you aware of the common mistakes people make when creating their Apple ID passwords, such as using weak passwords and personal information? And how often should you change your Apple ID password? If it's been a while since your last update, stay in this article to learn **how to change your Apple ID password on your account**.

![change apple id password on web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover **how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account**, here are three things you should consider:

- **Complexity**

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

- **Uniqueness**

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 14, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 14 device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 14, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 14.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 14 and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 14 and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 14 was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 14 in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 14 and unlock Apple iPhone 14.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 14

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 14, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 14:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 14 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 14 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 14 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 14/Apple iPhone 14 mini/Apple iPhone 14 Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 14 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 14 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 14 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 14 range builds on the Apple iPhone 14 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 14 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 14 lineup. the Apple iPhone 14 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 14 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 14 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 14 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 14 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 14 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 14 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 14 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 14 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 14. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 14 and unlocking it.
