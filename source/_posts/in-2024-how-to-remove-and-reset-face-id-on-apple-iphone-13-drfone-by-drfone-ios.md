![face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

If the new Apple iPhone 13 is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 13 from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 13 13, the Apple iPhone 13 14, and now the Apple iPhone 13 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 13 13/12/11 with Face ID:

As mentioned earlier, turning off Find My iPhone can be very complex. But if your Apple iPhone 13 is damaged in some way, turning it off can be much more stressful. Here, iCloud can come to the rescue as it’s the most effective solution for how to turn off Find My iPhone when your phone is broken.

Here we have explained to you step by step how to turn off Find My iPhone on broken iPhone using iCloud:

**Step 1:** Go to the official website of iCloud.com and enter your credentials to sign in with your Apple ID.

**Step 2:** Click on the "Find My iPhone" icon at the end of the page. The app will start locating your device, but as your Apple iPhone 13 is damaged, it might not find anything.

## Part 4: Turn off Find My iPhone using Recovery Mode

The recovery model of the Apple iPhone 13 allows you to reset or restore your data. It also offers data cleaning and backing up of apps to keep your Apple iPhone 13 updated and free of glitches. When your phone is lagging or not working properly, then you need to put it into Recovery Mode.

However, Recovery Mode can also be useful to turn off Find My iPhone on your device. Here are the steps that will guide you on how to turn off Find My iPhone on a broken phone using Recovery Mode.

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 13 to your computer via cable and wait for your computer to detect your device.

**Step 2:** As soon as your Apple iPhone 13 is detected, open iTunes and force restart your phone to activate the Recovery Mode. Activating this mode is different for different models of iPhone.

- For iPhone 8 and the later: Press the Volume Down button and release is immediately. Then press the Volume Up button and release it immediately again. After that, press and hold the Power Button until you see the Apple logo.
- For iPhone 7 and 7+: Press the Power Button and Volume Down button at the same time and hold them until the Apple logo appears on your screen.
- For iPhone 6s, and Previous Models: Press and hold the Home Button and Power button concurrently until your Apple iPhone 13 shows the Apple logo.

Once your Apple iPhone 13 shows the Apple logo, it means the Recovery Mode is activated.
