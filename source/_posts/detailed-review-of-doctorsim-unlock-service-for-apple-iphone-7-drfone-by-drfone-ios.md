It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 7 without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.
