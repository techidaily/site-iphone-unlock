It's a frustrating situation where you forgot your Apple iPhone 11's passcode and are now unable to unlock it. Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone 11, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode.

There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone's stock features like Find My Apple iPhone 11 or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 lock screen.

So, let's get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 lock screen.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 11 without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 11 passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

![using itunes to unlock iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg)

## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone 11 backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

If you forget your password, you will be required to reset it before being able to access your backups again.

### iCloud and iTunes Backup Password

Resetting your password may be done in different methods, depending on whether or not you have an iCloud account. You may reset your iCloud password by visiting the iCloud website and following the steps. This requires that you already have an iCloud account.

Connecting your device to a computer and using the iTunes program will allow you to reset your password even if you do not have an iCloud account. After successfully changing your password, you can access your backups the same way as before.

In addition, iCloud requires you to enter your Apple ID and password to access your backup file. This means that only you can access your backup and that it will be more difficult for someone else to gain access to it.
