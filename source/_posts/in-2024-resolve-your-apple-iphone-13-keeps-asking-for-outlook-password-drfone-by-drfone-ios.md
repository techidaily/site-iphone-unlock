## Part 1. Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking for Outlook Password

The **iPhone asking for Outlook password** arises from a combination of factors. Understanding these reasons is crucial in diagnosing and resolving the problem effectively:

### 1\. Incorrect Password Entry

Users might unknowingly enter the wrong password. They may have changed their Outlook password without updating it on their iPhones. This mismatch can trigger continuous password prompts.

### 2\. Outdated Mail App

An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone 13 may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone 13 keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

Upholding a stable internet connection is necessary for effortless communication. An unreliable or unstable network can disrupt the synchronization process in Outlook.

### 4\. Corrupted Email Account Profile

A corrupted email account profile on the Apple iPhone 13 can cause disruptions during the authentication process. Resetting the email account on the Apple iPhone 13 device might be necessary to resolve the issue.

### 5\. Third-Party App Interference

Other mail applications installed on the Apple iPhone 13 can also cause an issue. They might interfere with the Outlook app's proper functioning. Identifying and temporarily disabling such apps can help diagnose and resolve the issue.

### 6\. Excessive Email Fetching

Configuring the Outlook mail app to fetch emails too frequently causes the issue. It can strain the connection with Outlook servers, leading to authentication challenges. That causes issues like the Apple iPhone 13 asking for a password.

### 7\. iOS Software Glitches

The smooth functioning of the Mail app may be disrupted by problems and malfunctions present in the iOS software. Compatibility issues could emerge if your device is not operating on the latest iOS version.

## Unlocking Apple iPhone 13  Lock Screen: 3 Foolproof Methods that Actually Work

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

The competition in the market between Android and iOS has been increased ever since the features are increasing. People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.

Looking more into the Apple iPhone 13 world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 13 . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 13 device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 13 device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

### 1\. How to select your favorite wallpaper

The second way to have a customized lock screen is to use a Live Photo. To do this, go to Settings > Wallpapers & Brightness > Choose a New Wallpaper. Then, select the Live Photo option and choose the image you want to use.

**Note:** You can only use Live Photos for your lock screen if your Apple iPhone 13 is unlocked.

### 2\. How to manage notifications

If you want to manage notifications on the iOS 17 lock screen, there are two ways to do it.

At first, you can go to Settings > Notifications. Here, you can choose how many notifications you want to see on your lock screen and which apps can send you notifications.

The Do Not Disturb feature is the second way to manage notifications. To do this, go to Settings > Do Not Disturb and enable the feature. You can also schedule when Do Not should turn on and off. This feature work like a charm if you want to silence all notifications at night.

### 3\. How to set Auto-Lock time

If you want to set the Auto-Lock time, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock. Here, you can choose how long it should take for your Apple iPhone 13 to lock automatically.

By default, the Auto-Lock time is set to 30 seconds. But you can choose to lock it immediately, after 1 minute, 5 minutes, or never.

## How to Turn Off/On Lock Screen in iOS 17?

If you want to turn off the lock screen, go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode (or Face ID & Passcode). Then, scroll down and disable the Unlock with Passcode (or Unlock with Face ID) option.

Enable the Unlock with Passcode (or Unlock with Face ID) to turn ON the lock screen.

## How to Bypass the iOS 17 Lock Screen Passcode?

Different methods can help you bypass the iOS 17 lock screen passcode. Let's discuss them in detail.
