2. **Is it possible to reset the Apple iPhone SE (2022) passcode with an Apple ID?**

No, you cannot reset the Apple iPhone SE (2022) passcode using Apple ID. Both are different security measures and cannot reset one using another.

3. **What should I know about the screen time passcode?**

Parental controls on iPhones use a different passcode to restrict content. It includes restricting things like privacy, game center, web content, explicit content, iTunes app and purchases. It is also known as a restriction passcode.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone SE (2022), Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2022). So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone SE (2022) with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone SE (2022) is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone SE (2022) Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone SE (2022) from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone SE (2022), or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone SE (2022) and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone SE (2022) does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.
