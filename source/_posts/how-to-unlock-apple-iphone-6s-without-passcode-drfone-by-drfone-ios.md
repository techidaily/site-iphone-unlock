There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone 6s without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone's stock features like Find My Apple iPhone 6s or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 6s lock screen.

So, let's get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 6s lock screen.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 6s without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 6s passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.
