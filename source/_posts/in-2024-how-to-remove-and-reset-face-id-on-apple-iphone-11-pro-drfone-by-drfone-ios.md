If the new Apple iPhone 11 Pro is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 11 Pro from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro 14, and now the Apple iPhone 11 Pro 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13/12/11 with Face ID:

Step 3: Look at your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### II.V Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 11 Pro is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 11 Pro will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!

- Connect it to the PC you sync with, and open iTunes. If they request a password, use another PC you've connected with. If that also doesn't work, go for the recovery mode.
- iTunes will coordinate your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and make a backup. When the sync and backup are done, click Restore iPhone.
- Select your Apple iPhone 11 Pro in iTunes and pick the latest backup.
- You'll then see the "Set Up" screen after that. Here, tape on the "Restore from iTunes Backup" choice.

## Part 3: How to Unlock iPhone with Siri If its Screen is broken

Siri is a voice assistant on Apple devices. Like other devices have Alexa and Google Assistant, iPhone has Siri. It empowers you to use the Apple iPhone 11 Pro through voice commands. You can converse with Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro password.

How might Siri unlock iPhone? One can use bugs in Siri to unlock iPhone. However, it is only possible in a few iOS versions.

**Step 1.** First and foremost, enable Siri. You should hold the home button of your locked iPhone and say 'Hello Siri' to enact her.

You need to ask Siri, "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, what time is it in the USA"? That will permit Siri to open the World Clock on your home screen.

**Step 2.** Presently, tap on the world clock symbol. Now, tap on the + sign in the upper right corner to add the clock feature to the home screen.

**Step 3.** At the point when another clock is added, you will have the choice to share the new clock.

**Step 4.** Click on the share button and Pick the Message choice.

**Step 5.** You don't need to text a message. Instead, add something arbitrary in the "To" field.

**Step 6.** Add Siri to make another contact by tapping on the new or + symbol. Siri will open the New Contact interface with details like adding the name, photo, etc.

**Step 7.** Add the photo from the photo library. Tap on "Add Photo," and it will open the library for you. Tap on Select Photo, and Siri will unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device and let you pick a photo.

**Step 8.** When the photo library is open, tap on the home button or return button to get back to the unlock screen to get to the Settings symbol.

**Step 9.** When you open your settings, you can now refresh your credentials. This might work by making a Face ID rather than a password to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

Besides, it works for iPhones with iOS 8.0 to 10.1. These bugs are fixed in the later versions of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro and won't assist you with fooling Siri into unlocking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.
