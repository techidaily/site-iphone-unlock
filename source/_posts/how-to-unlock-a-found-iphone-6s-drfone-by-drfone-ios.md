You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 6s lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 6s mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 6s models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 6s models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 6s mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 6s 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 6s is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 6s and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s and unlocking it.
