## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro, Apple's New iPhone

So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 13 Pro with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Locked?

In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 13 Pro does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.
