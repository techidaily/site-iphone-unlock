### II.IV: Unlock Disabled iPhone Without A Computer (Find My App)

Not so long ago, a computer was a necessity in every household for various reasons. Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone X and iPad.

The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users' requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.

So, in today's time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?

Worry not, because Apple's Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.

**Step 1:** Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone X device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).

![unlock disabled iphone with find my app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone X devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone X device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.

Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.
