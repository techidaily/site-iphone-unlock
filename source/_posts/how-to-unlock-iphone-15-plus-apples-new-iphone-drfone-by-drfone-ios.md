## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 15 Plus from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 15 Plus and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 15 Plus does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and click Erase iPhone and confirm.
