If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 mini, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again.

Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 12 mini device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
