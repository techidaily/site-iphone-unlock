### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

## Part 4: About data loss after unlocking Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode

As you can see, in all the above-mentioned solutions, your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max data would be lost while unlocking its passcode. This is because, as of now, there is no way to unlock an iPhone without restoring it. Needless to say, while restoring a device, its data is automatically lost. Since Apple is quite concerned about the security of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and the sensitivity of its data, it doesn’t let users unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device without losing their data.

Even though lots of users have complained about this issue, Apple hasn’t come up with a solution yet. The best way to avoid this scenario is by taking a regular backup of your data. You can either backup your data on iCloud, via iTunes, or by using any third-party tool as well. In this way, you won’t be able to lose your important files while unlocking your device’s passcode.
