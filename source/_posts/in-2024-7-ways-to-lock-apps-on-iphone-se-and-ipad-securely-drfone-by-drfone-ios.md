### I.III: Unlock Apple iPhone SE Without Passcode Through The iCloud Website (Find My iPhone)

If the Apple iPhone SE had Find My enabled before it got locked, and you have the iCloud credentials that the Apple iPhone SE is locked to, you can use Find My on the iCloud website to unlock the locked iPhone.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://icloud.com> and sign in using the iCloud/ Apple ID used with the locked iPhone. If you use any other ID, you will not see this iPhone since it would not be attached to that ID.

**Step 2:** Click Find My and select your Apple iPhone SE.

![unlock iphone with icloud find my](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

iPhone will be unlocked and restored to factory settings. Fresh setup will be required.

### I.IV: Unlock Apple iPhone SE Without A Computer (Find My App)

What to do if there is no computer nearby and all you have is another iPad or iPhone? Please do not panic, as you can use Find My on any Apple device to erase and unlock the Apple iPhone SE provided the same Apple ID as the locked iPhone is used.

This means that it might be easier for you if you have another Apple device signed in to the same iCloud as the locked iPhone, else you will need to temporarily sign out of the account on that device and sign in with the requisite account. It is cumbersome, but it is better than nothing in a pinch.

**Step 1:** Launch Find My app on your macOS or iOS device.

![unlock iphone with find my app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select the locked iPhone from the list of devices, click or tap it on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.

The unlocked iPhone will be erased, and factory settings restored on the Apple iPhone SE device, requiring a new setup after the restart.

If your locked iPhone is not on the list of devices, and you cannot do anything, feel free to pay a visit to an Apple Store, as they will have all resources required to get your Apple iPhone SE unlocked and working again.

## Part II: FAQs

Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.

### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone SE device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone SE without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone SE is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone SE device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

So, if you have forgotten your Apple iPhone SE passcode and are looking for how to unlock Apple iPhone SE without passcode, use this guide to pick one of the three easy ways to unlock Apple iPhone SE in case of forgotten passcode.
