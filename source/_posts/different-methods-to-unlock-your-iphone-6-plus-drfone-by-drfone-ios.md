**Step 2. Recovery or DFU Mode Boot**

It is necessary to first boot your locked device in recovery or DFU mode. Follow the guidelines on your screen to do so. The Recovery mode is the suggested way for iOS screen locks. If you can't actuate this mode, go for the DFU mode boot.

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 3. Select your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Model**

After the phone is in recovery/DFU mode, the program will show the locked device's information. Here you can see the model and iOS variant of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device. If it isn't correct, you could choose the right one from the dropdown menu next to it. After that, click the Download button to get the required firmware for your locked phone.

Simply in no time, Dr.Fone will successfully unlock your device.

**Note:** This unlocking process will erase everything off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and bring it to the factory default state. Indeed, no other method that doesn't allow data erasure at the moment.


## Part 2: How to Turn Off Passcode or Face ID on My Device?

Face ID can be a helpful method for unlocking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus - by simply looking at your phone. However, a few clients might worry that it's not as secure as utilizing a PIN to open your phone. If that is the best case for you, you can follow this manual to disable Face ID and depend on a passcode.

Here's the step-by-step guide to the most effective method to switch off Face ID on the iPhone:

### 1\. Open the Settings application

First, tap on your Settings app to open it. That is the one on the home screen with a symbol like the mechanical gear.

### 2\. Tap on Face ID and Passcode

On the Settings menu, tap on the Face ID and Passcode menu.

![passcode menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-6.jpg)

### 3\. Enter your passcode

At this stage, you'll be approached to enter your passcode, so do this to get to the Face ID and Passcode menu.

### 4\. Switch off Face ID

You'll have the option to turn off the switch for Face ID across different activities, including the phone unlock.

## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

### The Bottom Line

That's all about our take on **how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.** We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand. However, we strongly suggest Dr.Fone if you still face issues with our solutions. Even if the above methods fail, Dr.Fone will ensure you unlock your phone.
