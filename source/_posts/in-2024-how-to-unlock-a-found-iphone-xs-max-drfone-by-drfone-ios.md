## Part 2. \[Old Ways\] Using Siri To Unlock Stolen iPhone

It might come as a surprise to you that Siri can be used to unlock a lost iPhone. When you seek the answer to **how to unlock a lost iPhone** with Siri, you need to be aware of a very specific pointer. It is necessary to note that this method only works for devices operating between iOS 8 and 11.

This later turned out to be an anomaly in Siri that led users to unlock their iOS devices. If you have a device running within this iOS version range, learn how to unlock it with the provided steps:

- **Step 1.** Start by activating the Siri on your iOS device. Ask a simple question about time, like "What time is it?" Once Siri is active, a clock will display on your device screen.

Enter the name of any city in the “Search Bar,” tap Select All, and choose “Share.”
