## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone SE (2020)  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone SE (2020)  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

**Step 2:** Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.

Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.

### FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?

iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.

### FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. All data on the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device will be deleted in the process. There is currently no way to unlock disabled iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 3: How to restore data via iCloud?

After unlocking the disabled iPhone, when you set it up again, if you previously had iCloud Backup enabled, you will get the option to restore data from the latest backup.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled In Future

By now, you know that should the Apple iPhone SE (2020) be disabled for any reason, unlocking the disabled iPhone is a process that will wipe the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device clean. And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?

A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.

If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.

### Conclusion

It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.

But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone? The ways outlined in this guide will help you unlock your disabled iPhone.
