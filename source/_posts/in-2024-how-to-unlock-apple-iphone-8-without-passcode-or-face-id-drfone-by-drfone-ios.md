### Method 4: Unlock Your Apple iPhone 8 Without Swiping Up via AutoUnlockX

AutoUnlockX is a tweak designed for jailbroken iPhones. It enhances the Apple iPhone 8 device's unlocking experience by automatically bypassing the lock screen. That is when certain conditions are met. Jailbreaking involves bypassing the software restrictions imposed by Apple. Here are the steps to **iPhone 11 unlock screen without swiping**:

**Step 1.** Begin by adding an external repository like Sileo or Cydia, which will serve as an emulator. Remember, it won't be automatically added to your applications; you'll need to do this manually. So, download the repository from the [SparkDev](https://www.sparkdev.me/) website (it's not available on the App Store). Head to the "Tweaks" tab, find "AutoUnlockX," and download it to your device.

**Step 2.** Following this, go to "Sources" in your Apple iPhone 8's Settings, select "Edit," and manually add the external repo to Cydia or Sileo. Open Sileo or Cydia and navigate to the "Search" page. In the search bar, type "AutoUnlockX." Once the tweak appears, select it, and then tap "Get (Sileo)" or "Install (Cydia)."

**Step 3.** Confirm the selected repo by tapping the "Confirm" option and allow the tweak to install. Once installed, tap "Restart SpringBoard" to complete the download. After your Apple iPhone 8 resprings, proceed to enable AutoUnlockX.

**Step 4.** Open Settings, tap on "App," and then select "AutoUnlockX." Toggle on "Enable Auto Unlock." Customize other settings as desired by tapping on them to turn them on or off.

**Step 5.** When finished, tap the "Respring" option at the bottom to apply your changes. At last, unlock your Apple iPhone 8 using your Face ID effortlessly.

### Method 5: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up via Voice Control

Utilizing Voice Control to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 offers a hands-free approach to accessing your device. It is especially helpful for individuals with accessibility needs. There are situations where manual interaction might be challenging. Here's a guide on how to set up and use “Voice Control” to unlock your Apple iPhone 8:

## Conclusion

To conclude, we have explored different ways to **unlock iPhones without swiping up** beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We've talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.

While these methods are helpful, there's a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that's particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can't get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called "Screen Unlock" that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.
