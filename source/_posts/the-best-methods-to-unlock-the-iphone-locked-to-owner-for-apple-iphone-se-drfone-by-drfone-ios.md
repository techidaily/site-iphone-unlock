## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone SE

Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone SE device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone SE device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone SE device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone SE device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone SE device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone SE device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone SE device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone SE Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone SE locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone SE device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone SE device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone SE device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone SE:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone SE device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone SE:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

![select find my feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone SE from "All Devices." Now choose "Erase iPhone" from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone SE device and remove the Activation Lock.

![tap on erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg)

### Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone SE Locked to Owner

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone SE device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone SE to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.

The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone SE device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone SE Activation Lock:

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone SE is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone SE Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.
- ****Step 2:**** Select "More Wi-Fi Settings" using the "i" symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose "Configure DNS" and follow it by selecting the "Manual" option.
- ****Step 3:**** Afterward, press "Add Server," located under "DNS Servers." Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:

- For users in the United States/North America: 104.154.51.7
- For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90
- For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58
- For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60

![use the dns method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg)

- ****Step 4:**** Save the changes by selecting "Save." Use the back arrow button to go back and choose "Ask to Join Networks." Enter the network password and tap "Join." Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone SE attempts to activate. Afterward, continue to set up your Apple iPhone SE.

### Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service

What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn't working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone SE. All you need to provide them is your Apple iPhone SE IMEI number. The process is done remotely and takes 24 to 48 hours to complete.

Ensure your device IMEI is not blacklisted before sending it for the unlocking process. Described below are steps to use [<u>DirectUnlocks</u>](https://directunlocks.com/en_us/icloud-unlock), an iCloud Activation removal service:

- ****Step 1:**** Use your computer's browser to visit the official DriectUnlocks website. Enter your Apple iPhone SE's IMEI number and select the Apple iPhone SE model in the provided box.
- ****Step 2:**** Once you have entered the details, tap "Remove Activation Lock." Afterward, select a payment method to pay for the service. It will take up to 48 hours to unlock your device.

## How To Fix Auto Lock Greyed Out on Apple iPhone SE

Auto-lock on iOS devices serves multiple purposes - it conserves battery life, secures your data, and more. But have you encountered the **Auto-Lock greyed-out** dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.

Read on if you've encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we'll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix **Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone** and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven't worked for you, we've got alternative solutions. Let's get started.

![auto lock greyed out on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?

There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone SE or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:

Low Power Mode

When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.

![low power mode on iphone enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg)

Screen Time Restrictions

[<u>Screen Time restrictions</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html) can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn't run out.

![screen time settings on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg)

MDM Profile Restrictions

If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can [<u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html).

![setup remote management on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg)

Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.

Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode

Your **iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out** because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone SE or iPad's **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down and tap **Battery**. It will show you your device's battery usage and available settings.
- **Step 3:** Turn off the **Low Power Mode**. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.

![iphone turn off low power mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg)

Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in ****Settings**** so it stays awake for as long as you like.

Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions

You've ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the **Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad** or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn't causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Screen Time,** then scroll down.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Turn Off Screen Time**.

![turn off screen time on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg)

Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile

A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone SE device's default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.

Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out ****Auto-Lock on iPad****, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.

- **Step 1:** See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.

- Go to **Settings**\> **General** > **VPN & Device Management** on your Apple iPhone SE.
- Go to **Settings**\> **General** > **Profiles & Device Management** on your iPad.

- **Step 2:** Select the configuration profile you need to delete.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Remove Profile**, enter your device passcode, then tap **Remove**.

![remove configuration profile on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg)

Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM

Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees' iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.

If you're having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company's authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.

If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **General** > **Profile** or **VPN & Device Management** (or a similar section).
- **Step 3:** Select the management and tap **Remove Management**.

![remove mdm profile on ipad](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg)

If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company's mobile device management platform can remove it.

Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss

Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they're associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there's good news. [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.

Best Practices To Secure Your iOS Data

**Changing your Apple ID on your iPad** can be a great way to protect your privacy and security. However, it's important to take steps to ensure that your iOS data remains safe during the process. Here are some tips to help you do just that:

- **Backup Your Files**

Before you **change your Apple ID on your iPad**, create a [<u>backup of your data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup/backup-iphone-with-broken-screen.html) so you don't lose important files. You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.

Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you're getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.
