After carefully following the steps mentioned above, you are ready to **unlock your Face ID with a mask**. Remember that Face ID will scan and focus mainly on your eyes and forehead.

- You should be wearing the Apple Watch on your wrist, and it must be unlocked.
- Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max should be upgraded to iOS 14.5 or above.
- The wrist detection on your phone should be activated.
