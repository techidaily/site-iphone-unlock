**Step 5:** Lastly, wait for the process to complete and upon completion set up your device as usual.

## Part 5. How about Apple iPhone 12 restrictions passcode?

Apple iPhone 12 restrictions is a vital setting that is used to lock down a set of functions of the iPhone. These iPhone restrictions are also known as Parental Controls. That implies one can make use of these settings to block or hide songs that have explicit lyrics/content or barring YouTube from running, etc.

It is vital to set up a 4 digit passcode if you want to use iPhone restriction settings. Now, if you somehow forgot the passcode that was set to make use of iPhone restrictions, you need to restore your Apple iPhone 12 with the help of iTunes to remove the previous passcode. But ensure not to restore an old backup of iPhone or else, the old passcode which you may not know will also get activated. Eventually, making your situation even worse.

**Reset/Change Apple iPhone 12 restrictions passcode**

Now, in case you know the Apple iPhone 12 restrictions passcode and just wish to reset it. Then follow the streak of steps mentioned below.

1. Launch “Settings” of your Apple iPhone 12 and then get into “General” followed by “Restrictions”. Now, you’ll be asked to key in the current passcode.
