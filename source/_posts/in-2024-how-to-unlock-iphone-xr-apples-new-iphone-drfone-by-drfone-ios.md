## How to Unlock Apple iPhone XR, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone XR. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone XR with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone XR is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone XR Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone XR is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone XR from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone XR, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone XR and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone XR does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

**Step 2:** Enter your current Passcode when prompted.

**Step 3:** Scroll down and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'ON' position.

**Step 4:** Enter a new 6-digit passcode when prompted. Then, please enter it again to confirm.

That's it! Your Passcode is now turned ON, and your device is more secure than ever.

To shut down the Passcode on your Apple iPhone XR, follow the steps above and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'OFF' position.

### The Bottom Line

As you see in the article, there are some ways to reset your Apple iPhone XR passcode. However, if you're looking for an easy and effective solution, we recommend using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock. It is a professional tool that can unlock your Apple iPhone XR without a passcode. Plus, it doesn't cause any damage to the Apple iPhone XR device, which is always a good thing.

If you're not interested in using a third-party tool, you can try one of the methods mentioned above. But keep in mind that these methods may only work on some iPhones. So, if you need help deciding which way to use it, we recommend going with Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock.
