### Way 4. Check the iCloud Status Page

Verifying the status of Apple's services, including iCloud, can help determine if there's an ongoing outage. The Apple Status page provides real-time information about Apple's service. It displays disruptions, maintenance, or outages that might impact a service's availability. Follow these steps to check the iCloud Status page:

**Instructions.** Using a web browser on your computer or smartphone, go to the [System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) page provided by Apple. Check the status for services such as “Apple ID,” “iCloud Accounts & Sign In,” and other services. The fault lies at Apple's end if the indicators in front of these services are another color than green.
