It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

### Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue

After a while, it might permanently disable your Apple iPhone 14 Plus from being accessed through a passcode or any other direct security unlocking option. However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.
