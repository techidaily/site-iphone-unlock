### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:

![hard reset iphone 6 while locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/factory-reset-locked-iphone-without-itunes-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the " Sleep/Wake " button and the " Home " button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.

**Step 2:** After 10 seconds have passed, release the " Sleep/Wake " button but keep holding the " Home " button.

**Step 3:** Keep holding the " Home " button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

**Step 4:** Here, you will be in recovery mode, and now you can reset your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

Your device will now be reset, and you will have a phone like a new one.

### 5\. How can I get into a locked iPhone?

If you have lost the passcode of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, then you can use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool to factory reset your device. To do this, you need to proceed with the steps given above. They are easy to follow and will help you reset your device without risk.

### The Bottom Line

These are some of the most effective methods that can help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes. You can use any of these methods to reset your device and get rid of the lock screen.

However, if you want to factory reset your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max because you have forgotten your passcode, we recommend using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock app because it is the most effective and safe method.

This app can help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes in just a few minutes, and it is very easy to use. So, if you want to reset your device without any data loss, we recommend using this app.
