## Part 4: How to get into a locked Apple iPhone 12 with Siri?

If you don’t want to erase your device’s data while resolving this issue, you can use Siri.

**Step 1.** To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.
