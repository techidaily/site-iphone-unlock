If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free.

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.
