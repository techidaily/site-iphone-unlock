### Method 5: Unlock iPhone via Erase iPhone Features (iOS 15.2)

With iOS 15.2, Apple introduced the Erase iPhone feature, aiding users in resetting devices with forgotten passcodes. The functionality applies to iPhones connected to the network with a broken Home button. Compatible devices include iPhone 6 series, iPhone SE series, and newer models. However, it comes at the cost of erasing all content and data on the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1**: Power on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) by tapping the Power button, then enter the wrong passcode multiple times until the **Erase iPhone** button appears at the bottom right corner of the screen.

![erase iphone process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-iphone-without-home-button-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Tap the **Erase iPhone** button and input your Apple ID passcode to initiate the process. Once the Apple logo displays on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) screen, you can now access your device without the need for a passcode.

**_**_Note_**__**_：_**_****Keep in mind that all previous content and data on the phone will be erased during this operation.**

### Method 6: Unlock iPhone via iTunes/Finder

For Mac or Windows users, both Finder and iTunes can **unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) without the Home button**. Windows or Mac Mojave users are recommended to use iTunes. Mac Catalina and newer users should use Finder. Before using iTunes or Finder, it's advisable to back up your Apple iPhone SE (2020) on iCloud. Here's how to proceed:

- **Step 1:** Put your Apple iPhone SE (2020) in the recovery mode and connect it to the computer. Launch Finder or iTunes for Windows or Mac Mojave users.

![itunes finder iphone recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-iphone-without-home-button-12.jpg)

- **Step 2**: A window in Finder will prompt you to choose between restoring or updating; click **Restore**. Confirm your action by tapping **Restore** again. Upon completion, your Apple iPhone SE (2020) will be unlocked without the Home button.

### Method 7: Unlock iPhone via iCloud

If none of the methods work or Dr.Fone is unavailable to you for some reason, then you can use iCloud. To **unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) without the Home button**, visit iCloud.com and sign in with your Apple ID. Next, go to **Find My iPhone**, select your device, and choose **Erase iPhone** to unlock it remotely.

This unconventional method involves using the charging cable to apply gentle pressure on the Home button. Be cautious to avoid excessive force.

**Visit the Apple Store if Covered by a Warranty**
