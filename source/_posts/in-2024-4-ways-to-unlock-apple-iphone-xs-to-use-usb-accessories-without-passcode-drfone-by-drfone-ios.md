Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone XS screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers.

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone XS Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone XS. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone XS getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone XS's data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone XS's status.

### Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone

- **Step 5:** Because this technique requires you to jailbreak your iOS device, you will be prompted to do so first. Click on **Jailbreak Guide** if you wish to follow a guide. If you want to follow a video guide instead, click on **Watch Video**.
- **Step 6:** After that, the screen will prompt you to conduct a series of actions, beginning with removing the SIM card from the iDevice. Continue to **Settings,** then **WLAN**, to access the Apple iPhone XS device's network settings. Locate the Wi-Fi networks you have joined and select **Forget This Network**. Remove all linked networks from **My Networks** and disable Wi-Fi. After that, re-insert your SIM card and tap **Continue**.
