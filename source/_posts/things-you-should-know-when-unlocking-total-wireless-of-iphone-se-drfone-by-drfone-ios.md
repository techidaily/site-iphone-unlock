- **Step 2.** After signing in, click the "App Grid" icon on the top right corner and choose "Find My" from the options. On the Find iPhone page, you will see a list of devices associated with your iCloud account. Select your Apple iPhone SE from the list.

![tap on the find my feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/unlock-iphone-14-4.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Look for the "Erase iPhone" option from the Apple iPhone SE device details and tap on it. This will start the erasure process on your Apple iPhone SE. Afterward, follow the on-screen instructions to erase your Apple iPhone SE. Once it is done, your device will be unlocked, and you will be able to set it up.

![select erase iphone option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/unlock-iphone-14-5.jpg)

#### Pros

- With internet access, you can unlock your Apple iPhone SE remotely from any computer or device.
- It allows you to locate your Apple iPhone SE 14 or iPhone 14 Pro in case of you misplacing your device.

#### Cons

### Method 2: Using iTunes on Your Computer

Restoring your Apple iPhone SE with iTunes is another method to unlock your device when you have forgotten the passcode. This method involves using iTunes on a computer to erase your Apple iPhone SE and install the latest iOS version.

For it, ensure you have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer. Using this method will also result in losing all your data on the iPhone. Follow these steps to unlock **iPhone 14 Pro Max** with iTunes:

- **Step 1.** Launch iTunes on your computer and connect your Apple iPhone SE to your computer using a USB cable. Now first press and release the "Volume Up" button. Then repeat the same process with the "Volume Down" button.
- **Step 2.** Finally, press and hold the "Side" button until your Apple iPhone SE transitions to Recovery Mode. Now iTunes will detect your Apple iPhone SE in Recovery Mode. It will display a pop-up message asking whether you want to restore or update your device.

![enable the recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/unlock-iphone-14-6.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Here, choose the "Restore" option. It will erase all data on your device and install the latest iOS version. Once it is complete, you will see the initial setup screen on your Apple iPhone SE.

![press the restore button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/unlock-iphone-14-7.jpg)

#### Pros

- Recovery Mode is supported by iTunes on Windows or macOS versions prior to Catalina and by Finder on macOS Catalina and later.
- If the passcode or Face ID issue is related to a software glitch or corruption, Recovery Mode can help restore your device to a stable state.

#### Cons

- Users unfamiliar with Recovery Mode can get their devices stuck in it if they make a mistake.

## Part 3: Tips for Successful Apple iPhone SE Unlocking

Unlocking your Apple iPhone SE can be a delicate process. To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:

### 1\. Check Device Eligibility

Make sure your Apple iPhone SE is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone SE 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.

### 2\. Backup Your Data

Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone SE, [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.

If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.

### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone SE's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.

Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone SE 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn't been unlocked during this time.

When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone SE to the computer.

## Conclusion

To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone SE can be daunting when you've forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues. Thankfully, there are different methods available to regain access to your device. This article explored three methods: using iCloud's Find My iPhone, restoring with iTunes, and utilizing Dr.Fone. Each way offers its advantages and considerations.

After careful evaluation, we recommend Wondershare Dr.Fone as the best choice to [unlock your Apple iPhone SE](https://drfone.wondershare.com/solutions/iphone-lock-screen-password-forgot.html). It provides comprehensive features to unlock your device efficiently. Moreover, it offers a local backup option, ensuring that your data is safeguarded.
