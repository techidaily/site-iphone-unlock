When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.
