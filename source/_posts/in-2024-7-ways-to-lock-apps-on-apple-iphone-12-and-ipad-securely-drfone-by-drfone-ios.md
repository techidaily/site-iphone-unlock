## FAQs

### 1\. Can a Factory Reset Bypass the Lock screen Passcode on iPhone?

Yes. A factory reset will bypass the lock screen passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 and allow you to access it without a passcode. However, all your data will disappear, so make sure you have a backup.

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone 12 to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:
