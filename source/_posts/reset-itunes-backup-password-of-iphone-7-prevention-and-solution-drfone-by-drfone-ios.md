## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone 7 backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

If you forget your password, you will be required to reset it before being able to access your backups again.

### iCloud and iTunes Backup Password

Resetting your password may be done in different methods, depending on whether or not you have an iCloud account. You may reset your iCloud password by visiting the iCloud website and following the steps. This requires that you already have an iCloud account.

Connecting your device to a computer and using the iTunes program will allow you to reset your password even if you do not have an iCloud account. After successfully changing your password, you can access your backups the same way as before.

![password security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/reset-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

### Basic Ways for Password Security

To reset your password, go to the **Preferences** menu in iTunes, and click on the **Reset Password** button. You will be prompted to enter your old password and a new one. Please choose a strong password that cannot be easily guessed.

Another way to enhance the security of your Apple iPhone 7 backup is to use iCloud instead of iTunes. iCloud offers an extra layer of security, as your backup file will be encrypted when transmitted to iCloud.

In addition, iCloud requires you to enter your Apple ID and password to access your backup file. This means that only you can access your backup and that it will be more difficult for someone else to gain access to it.

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Did you go wrong when you set the Face ID the first time? Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone 7? And now, you want to disable the Face ID. Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn **how to remove Face ID** on your Apple iPhone 7 X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.

## Part I: What is Face ID?

![face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

If the new Apple iPhone 7 is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 7 from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 7 13, the Apple iPhone 7 14, and now the Apple iPhone 7 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 7 13/12/11 with Face ID:

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 7 X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 7 and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

## Part V: The Bottom Line
