### Way 3. Unlocking Apple Watch Activation Lock by Contacting Previous Owner

By contacting the previous owner, you can request them to remove the Apple iPhone 8 device from their iCloud account. Here's the procedure they can follow to unlock your Apple Watch, resulting in the Activation Lock bypass:

- **Step 1.** Access the [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) website via a web browser and sign in using the Apple ID. Click on the grid icon near the top right corner and select "Find My."
