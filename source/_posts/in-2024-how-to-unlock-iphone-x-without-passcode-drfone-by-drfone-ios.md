### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone X in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone X device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone X, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone X to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone X transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone X to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone X.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone X to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone X and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone X device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone X cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone X passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone X.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

**Step 3.** Tap the recently added reminder to open the "Reminders" application.

**Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode**

Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone X lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can't actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 3. Affirm iOS device information**

After putting the Apple iPhone X device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone X device information, for example, the Apple iPhone X device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.

**Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone X screen lock**

After the firmware is downloaded effectively, click Unlock Now to begin unlocking your Apple iPhone X/iPad.

Simply shortly, your Apple iPhone X will be unlocked effectively. Note that this unlocking process will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone X. However, it is practical to erase this issue from your device.

## Part 3: How Can I Turn Off/On My Passcode?

- Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Fingerprint and Password." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Password." Click this choice.
- Enter your current password.
- Look down until you track the "Turn Passcode Off" choice and tap it.
