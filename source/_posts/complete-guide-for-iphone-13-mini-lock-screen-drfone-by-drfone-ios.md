## Part 7: Hot FAQ about USB Accessories on iPhone

### Q1: What is the feature of USB Accessories on iPhone?

From USB-A to the latest, USB-C. Also, most iPhones use a proprietary Lightning port.

### Q2: Why does My iPhone Think My Charger is a USB Accessory?

- **Step 1**: Disconnect your tool from the accessory.
- **Step 2**: Unlock your device.
