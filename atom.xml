Here’s the Fix</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?"></a>Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?</h2><p>When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup unlocking never set by you.</p><p>But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let’s talk about them.</p><h2 id="Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.</p><p>One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone"></a>1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020), and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone SE (2020) using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone SE (2020) will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won’t take a lot of time at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png"                      alt="checking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup never set in the first place!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png"                      alt="removed"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone SE (2020). You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to “Reset All Settings” on your Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p>Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups.

The caveat? Account recovery can be lengthy and might take several days or longer. However, there are a few ways to expedite the recovery process:</p><ul><li>Confirm the six-digit code sent to your primary email address to prove that you’re the account’s rightful owner.</li><li>Provide your credit card details.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2020). So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone SE (2020) with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone SE (2020) is locked now. What to do?

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020), there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone SE (2020), you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone SE (2020) was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.</p><h3 id="II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="II.III Put The Apple iPhone SE (2020) in Recovery Mode"></a>II.III Put The Apple iPhone SE (2020) in Recovery Mode</h3><p>You can unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) using Recovery Mode, yourself.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to the computer and open iTunes.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.</p><p>Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone. Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value.

Once the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is jailbroken, the process will commence automatically to bypass the Activation Lock. A completion message will pop up on the window when the process finishes.

The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 12 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 12 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 12 to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 12 in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 12 device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 12 device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won’t directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.</p><p>When activated, it takes you to the lock screen, prompting Face ID, Touch ID, or Passcode to access the Apple iPhone 12 device again. Use the following steps to lock your apps using the Shortcuts app:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your Apple iPhone 12, launch the Shortcuts app and select the “Automation” tab from the bottom toolbar. There, tap “New Automation” and use the search bar to look for and select “App.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="choose app automation option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, tap “Choose” in front of the “App” and select the app you want to lock.

Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082527/7443" target="_top" id="2082527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security.

Therefore, if you don’t want your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and iPad to be misused by thieves, you should take some added measures. Follow these suggestions to increase security on your iOS device.</p><p>1. Disable Siri from the lock screen</p><p>If someone can’t access Siri from the lock screen, then they won’t be able to follow the above-mentioned process to unlock an iOS device. Therefore, it is highly recommended to disable Siri from the lock screen. To do this, visit your device’s Settings &gt; Touch ID &amp; Passcode, and under the “Allow access when locked” section, disable the option of “Siri.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994466282634.jpg"                      alt="turn off siri" title="turn off siri"                ></p><p>2. Enable Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus service</p><p>There are times when users forget to enable the Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus feature on their iOS device. To access this feature, make sure that it is turned on. To do this, go to your device’s Settings &gt; iCloud &gt; Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus and turn on the feature of “Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus.” Additionally, you should turn on the “Send the last location” option as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994466577687.jpg"                      alt="find my Apple iPhone 15 Plus" title="find my Apple iPhone 15 Plus"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>3. Set a strong alphanumeric password</p><p>One of the best ways to secure your iOS device is by adding secure passwords. To do this, visit your device’s Settings &gt; Touch ID &amp; Passcode &gt; Change Passcode and select the option of “Custom Alphanumeric Code.” Provide a strong alphanumeric passcode to boost the security of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994466798156.jpg"                      alt="custom Alphanumeric code" title="custom Alphanumeric code"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>By implementing the above suggestions, you can easily make your iOS device more secure.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 8. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 8 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 8 is locked now. What to do? Read on.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Locked"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 8 Locked?"></a>Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 8 Locked?</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 8 is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 8 from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn’t for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 8, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 8 and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.</p><p>We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 8 does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).</p><h3 id="II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-8"><a href="#II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-8" class="headerlink" title="II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 8"></a>II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 8</h3><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge is required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Dr.Fone is a set of modules that make life easy for you.

When you seek the answer to <strong>how to unlock a lost iPhone</strong> with Siri, you need to be aware of a very specific pointer. It is necessary to note that this method only works for devices operating between iOS 8 and 11.</p><p>This later turned out to be an anomaly in Siri that led users to unlock their iOS devices. If you have a device running within this iOS version range, learn how to unlock it with the provided steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Start by activating the Siri on your iOS device. Ask a simple question about time, like “What time is it?” Once Siri is active, a clock will display on your device screen. Next, access the clock and find the “World Clock” screen on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Tap the “+” button at the screen’s top right corner. Enter the name of any city in the “Search Bar,” tap Select All, and choose “Share.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="access world clocks via siri"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the sharing options, look for “Messages.” As you access the next screen, type anything in the “To” section and continue to select it by navigating to the “Create a New Contact” option. When providing the contact details, tap the “Add Photo” button. Lead into the Photos app from there and swipe up the screen or press the “Home” button to access the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="access photos app to unlock"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-All-Data-Lost-Trying-Recovery-Mode-for-Unlocking-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-All-Data-Lost-Trying-Recovery-Mode-for-Unlocking-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Remove it from Find My in iCloud"></a>2. Remove it from Find My in iCloud</h3><p>One more method for unlocking the Lost Mode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is to utilize the Find My iPhone application on the official iCloud site. Follow the steps underneath to do so:</p><ol><li>Go to &lt;<a href="http://www.icloud.com>">www.icloud.com&gt;</a> and utilize your account details to sign in.</li><li>Click the “Find My iPhone” button and select all iDevices.</li><li>Pick the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you need to unlock in Lost Mode and tap the “Lost Mode” button.</li><li>Click the “Stop Lost Mode” button to remove the lock from the phone.</li><li>Confirm this activity by clicking the “Stop Lost Mode” button again.</li></ol><h3 id="3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone’s information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device has an activation lock enabled.</p><p>The DNS bypass will send a fake “device isn’t locked” message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>:</p><ul><li>Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.</li><li>A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the “I” icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap “Forget this Network.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on “Configure DNS,” and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:</li></ul><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p><p>Asia: 104.155.28.90</p><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p><ul><li>Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network.

Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won’t work for everyone.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:</strong></p><ul><li>Click the “Emergency Call” option on your locked device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg"                      alt="emergency call"                ></p><ul><li>Dial “*#96274825*0000*1#,” then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.</li><li>If it’s not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn’t work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.</li><li>Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again.

When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.

Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 7 screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.</p><p>In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode.

Well, it’s like your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is in a timeout and can’t play with the other phones. Let’s break it down in simple terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklisted"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone"><a href="#What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?"></a>What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?</h3><p>When an iPhone is blacklisted, it’s been labeled as “not-so-friendly” in the digital world. It’s like when you’re not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.</p><h3 id="Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted"><a href="#Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?"></a>Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?</h3><p>There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:</p><ul><li>**Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That’s because protecting the original owner’s data and privacy is essential.</li><li>**Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn’t pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.</li></ul><h3 id="What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Is-Blacklisted"><a href="#What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Is-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Is Blacklisted?"></a>What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Is Blacklisted?</h3><p>Now, here’s where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted, it won’t work like it should. Here’s what you might experience:</p><ul><li>**No Calls or Texts.**You won’t be able to make or receive calls and texts. It’s like your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is suddenly mute.</li><li>**No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus will be like a disconnected island.</li><li>**Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, its value will drop if it’s blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.</li></ul><p>So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don’t have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 15 Plus back in action with some easy-to-follow <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> steps.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free</h2><p>Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 15 Plus to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let’s talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 15 Plus free. The good news is there’s a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklist removal"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal"><a href="#What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal" class="headerlink" title="What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?"></a>What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?</h3><p>Going through a <strong>blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus</strong> is like giving your device a second chance. It’s taking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

Make sure it’s not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone’s IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.</p><h3 id="Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Secure"><a href="#Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Secure" class="headerlink" title="Keep Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Secure"></a>Keep Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Secure</h3><p>Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.</p><h3 id="Pay-Your-Bills-on-Time"><a href="#Pay-Your-Bills-on-Time" class="headerlink" title="Pay Your Bills on Time"></a>Pay Your Bills on Time</h3><p>Your iPhone needs its “phone allowance” paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus getting blacklisted.</p><h3 id="Be-Careful-With-iCloud"><a href="#Be-Careful-With-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Be Careful With iCloud"></a>Be Careful With iCloud</h3><p>iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s data. Don’t share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s status.</p><h3 id="Report-a-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Report-a-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone"></a>Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone</h3><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Plus ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately.

Get Answers here"></a>What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 15 Pro i Do? Get Answers here</h2><p>Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>. Let’s start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone devices back view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?"></a>Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?</h2><p>Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, it’s crucial to understand, “<strong>What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone</strong>?” While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 15 Pro based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 15 Pro from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 15 Pro to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144297/7443" target="_top" id="2144297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144297/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>, leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password"></a>Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password</h2><p>Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It’s user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.</p><p>Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:</p><ul><li>Can remove all types of locked screen</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html"><u>Remove SIM lock</u></a>&#x2F; unlock iPhone carrier without losing data</li><li>Unlock Apple ID without a password</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>Bypass MDM without data loss</u></a></li><li>Remove iTunes backup encryption</li></ul><p>Dr.Fone uses the responsible path of jailbreaking your iOS device, giving you back control.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.</p><p>Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone.

People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.</p><p>Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 11 Pro world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 11 Pro . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  activation lock.

Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode.

Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open.

This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 6 backup unlocking never set by you.</p><p>But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let’s talk about them.</p><h2 id="Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.</p><p>One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone"></a>1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 6 backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 6 backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 6 backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 6, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 6 using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 6 using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 6 to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 6 device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4.

Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone 6 will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it.

Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn <strong>how to remove Face ID</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-I-What-is-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-I-What-is-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: What is Face ID?"></a>Part I: What is Face ID?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><p>If the new Apple iPhone 15 Pro is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 15 Pro from the 6&#x2F;7&#x2F;8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.</p><p>Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro 14, and now the Apple iPhone 15 Pro 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.</p><p>Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.</p><h2 id="Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?"></a>Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?</h2><p>Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode.

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 15 Pro in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.</p><p>Step 5: When done, tap Done.</p><p>In case you are getting the following error:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg"                      alt="face id error"                ></p><p>There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone 15 Pro can be used solely with passcodes if you want. If you find that your screen is locked and you can‘t unlock it, you can always find help in tools such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

Understand Terms and Conditions"></a>3. Understand Terms and Conditions</h3><p>Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding.

Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus  activation lock.

We know forgetting your Apple iPhone XR passcode can be a frustrating experience, but luckily it is possible to unlock your device. Using different methods, we will show you how to unlock your Apple iPhone XR 6 with a forgotten passcode.</p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode"></a>Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode</h2><p>Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we’ll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My iPhone"></a>1. Use Find My iPhone</h3><p>If you’ve activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn’t require any technical knowledge or special tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg"                      alt="find My Apple iPhone XR"                ></p><p>Just follow the steps below and get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com&#x2F;find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “All Devices” at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone XR from the list of devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Erase iPhone” and confirm that you want to erase your device.</li></ul><p>Once your Apple iPhone XR has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes"></a>2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone XR with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone XR, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone XR to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone XR is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the “Restore” or “Update” appears, please choose “Restore”.</li></ul><p>iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it’s finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Siri"><a href="#3-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Siri"></a>3. Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</li></ul><p>While this method doesn’t give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device’s features.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned methods works for you, or you don’t want to use them, there is another method that will surely work for you.

It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the “iPhone Locked to Owner” scenario can be hard as the fault doesn’t lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 13 mini device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 13 mini device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 13 mini device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 13 mini device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 13 mini device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 13 mini device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled.

But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8 removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>. Let’s start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone devices back view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?"></a>Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?</h2><p>Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8, it’s crucial to understand, “<strong>What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone</strong>?” While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 8 based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 8 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 8’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 8, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094476/7443" target="_top" id="2094476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 8 to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>, leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password"></a>Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password</h2><p>Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 8. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It’s user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.</p><p>Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:</p><ul><li>Can remove all types of locked screen</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html"><u>Remove SIM lock</u></a>&#x2F; unlock iPhone carrier without losing data</li><li>Unlock Apple ID without a password</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>Bypass MDM without data loss</u></a></li><li>Remove iTunes backup encryption</li></ul><p>Dr.Fone uses the responsible path of jailbreaking your iOS device, giving you back control.
