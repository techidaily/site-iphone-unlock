People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.</p><p>Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone X world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone X . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-X-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-X-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone X  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone X  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone X device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone X device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone X device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone X  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-X-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-X-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to a computer.

But have you encountered the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed-out</strong> dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.

From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.</p><p>Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don’t have to stress the next time you can’t log in to your account.</p><ol><li>Turn on “AutoFill” in “Settings”</li></ol><p>You can turn on <strong>AutoFill</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you’ve entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will save the information, so you don’t have to enter it again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg"                      alt="autofill"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords</li></ol><p>iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you’ve turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><ol start="3"><li>Use Notes for passwords</li></ol><p>If you’re finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it “Passwords.” Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.</p><p>You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it’s for.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094482/7443" target="_top" id="2094482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords.

Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone XS is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone XS ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone XS. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone XS device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

This method puts your phone into recovery mode with the help of iTunes or Finder on the computer. However, a small lousy side of this method is that it will erase your data along with the passcode.</p><p>Before you start, please ensure you have a computer (Mac or PC). If you’re using a PC, ensure it has Windows 8 or later and that iTunes is installed. Then, just follow the steps below to unlock your Apple iPhone XS without a password with iTunes.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your Apple iPhone XS through the following methods according to your Apple iPhone XS model.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/unlock-iphone-without-passcode-2.jpg"                      alt="turn off iphone"                ></p><p><strong><em>Notice:</em></strong> <em>If your phone is connected to the computer, please unplug your Apple iPhone XS.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Get ready by finding the button on your Apple iPhone XS, as shown in the pictures below.

Your computer downloads software for your Apple iPhone XS and begins the restore process. If the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits the recovery mode screen, let the download finish, turn off your Apple iPhone XS, and start again.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Notice:</em></strong> <em>Before the Finder or iTunes restores your Apple iPhone XS, it will back up the Apple iPhone XS data in iCloud. Thus, you can download the restored files after the Apple iPhone XS device restarts.</em></p><p>Now, you have learned how to unlock a disabled iPhone with iTunes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-8-Try-DFU-Mode-to-Bypass-iPhone-Passcode"><a href="#Part-8-Try-DFU-Mode-to-Bypass-iPhone-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try DFU Mode to Bypass iPhone Passcode"></a>Part 8: Try DFU Mode to Bypass iPhone Passcode</h2><p>DFU mode (Device Firmware Update) is a special mode on an iPhone that allows you to install firmware or software updates.

You can follow these steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode with Siri.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Firstly, hold the Home button on our phone to activate Siri. Speak a command like “Siri, what time is it?” to ask the present time.

We know forgetting your Apple iPhone XS Max passcode can be a frustrating experience, but luckily it is possible to unlock your device. Using different methods, we will show you how to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max 6 with a forgotten passcode.</p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode"></a>Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode</h2><p>Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we’ll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My iPhone"></a>1. Use Find My iPhone</h3><p>If you’ve activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn’t require any technical knowledge or special tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg"                      alt="find My Apple iPhone XS Max"                ></p><p>Just follow the steps below and get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com&#x2F;find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “All Devices” at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone XS Max from the list of devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Erase iPhone” and confirm that you want to erase your device.</li></ul><p>Once your Apple iPhone XS Max has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes"></a>2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone XS Max with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone XS Max, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone XS Max to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone XS Max is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the “Restore” or “Update” appears, please choose “Restore”.</li></ul><p>iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it’s finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Siri"><a href="#3-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Siri"></a>3. Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</li></ul><p>While this method doesn’t give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device’s features.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned methods works for you, or you don’t want to use them, there is another method that will surely work for you.

From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.</p><p>Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don’t have to stress the next time you can’t log in to your account.</p><ol><li>Turn on “AutoFill” in “Settings”</li></ol><p>You can turn on <strong>AutoFill</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 6 to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you’ve entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 6 will save the information, so you don’t have to enter it again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg"                      alt="autofill"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords</li></ol><p>iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you’ve turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 6.</p><ol start="3"><li>Use Notes for passwords</li></ol><p>If you’re finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it “Passwords.” Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.</p><p>You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it’s for.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone’s notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.</p><p>However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can’t even conceive. It’s best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-mastering-narratives-the-science-and-art-of-crafting-memorable-fb-stories/"><u>[New] Mastering Narratives The Science and Art of Crafting Memorable FB Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/erfect-your-mobile-shoot-expert-picks-of-the-best-9-cam-gear/"><u>[New] Perfect Your Mobile Shoot Expert Picks of the Best 9 Cam Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-liberate-your-video-files-free-online-tools-for-facebook-videos-in-1080phd/"><u>[Updated] Liberate Your Video Files - Free Online Tools for Facebook Videos in 1080P/HD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-unlock-apple-iphone-11-pro-without-passcode-or-face-id-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro without Passcode or Face ID | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/complete-guide-steps-for-a-thorough-windows-10-system-restore-using-revo-uninstaller-pro/"><u>Complete Guide: Steps for a Thorough Windows 10 System Restore Using Revo Uninstaller Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/elite-10-drone-fleet-capturing-visuals-in-new-light/"><u>Elite 10-Drone Fleet Capturing Visuals in New Light</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/enhanced-play-fixing-stutter-and-delays-for-a-smoother-rocket-league-game/"><u>Enhanced Play: Fixing Stutter and Delays for a Smoother Rocket League Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/exploring-the-giants-of-online-interaction-facebook-twitter-instagram-youtube-explained/"><u>Exploring the Giants of Online Interaction: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-xripad-without-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Disabled iPhone XR/iPad Without Computer | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-6-plus-passcode-without-itunes-without-knowing-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 6 Plus Passcode without iTunes without Knowing Passcode? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-your-iphone-se-in-security-lockout-proper-ways-to-unlock-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Is Your iPhone SE in Security Lockout?

Below, we’ll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My iPhone"></a>1. Use Find My iPhone</h3><p>If you’ve activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn’t require any technical knowledge or special tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg"                      alt="find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"                ></p><p>Just follow the steps below and get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com&#x2F;find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “All Devices” at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from the list of devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Erase iPhone” and confirm that you want to erase your device.</li></ul><p>Once your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes"></a>2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the “Restore” or “Update” appears, please choose “Restore”.</li></ul><p>iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it’s finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Siri"><a href="#3-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Siri"></a>3. Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</li></ul><p>While this method doesn’t give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device’s features.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned methods works for you, or you don’t want to use them, there is another method that will surely work for you.

Use the following steps to lock your apps using the Shortcuts app:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, launch the Shortcuts app and select the “Automation” tab from the bottom toolbar.

However, there can be setbacks during the process. Now, here’s what to do if you find yourself unable to do it and why it might be happening:</p><p>Try Again Later</p><p>If you encounter errors during the process, give it a little time and try again. Mayne it is because you <strong>changed your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to an iCloud email address within 30 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-07.jpg"                      alt="change apple id to icloud email"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115951/19272" target="_top" id="2115951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115951/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Check if Apple ID Is Already in Use</p><p>Apple IDs are unique, and you can’t have two identical ones. If you’re trying to change your Apple ID to one that’s already in use, you’ll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn’t already taken. Remove it from the family member’s account if they are using it.</p><p>Your Apple ID Is an Email Address</p><p>If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won’t be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.</p><p>If you’ve addressed these issues and still can’t change your Apple ID, don’t worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges. Contact them for guidance and solutions tailored to your situation.</p><p>However, if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> because you forgot or don’t have access to the password, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone.

Here’s the Fix</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?"></a>Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?</h2><p>When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup unlocking never set by you.</p><p>But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let’s talk about them.</p><h2 id="Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.</p><p>One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone"></a>1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone SE (2020) backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020), and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone SE (2020) using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone SE (2020) will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075483/7443" target="_top" id="2075483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won’t take a lot of time at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png"                      alt="checking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again.

The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone SE (2020). You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to “Reset All Settings” on your Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p>Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups.

If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.</p><p>They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That’s why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:</p><ul><li><strong>Frequent Login Requests</strong></li></ul><p>If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it’s a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg"                      alt="apple id sign in request"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unexpected Purchases</strong></li></ul><p>Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access.

It indicates unauthorized access attempts.</p><ul><li><strong>Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account</strong></li></ul><p>Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials.

Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as “123456” or “password.”</p><ul><li><strong>Length</strong></li></ul><p>Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.</p><p>Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2020). So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone SE (2020) with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone SE (2020) is locked now. What to do?

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020), there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone SE (2020), you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone SE (2020) was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.</p><h3 id="II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="II.III Put The Apple iPhone SE (2020) in Recovery Mode"></a>II.III Put The Apple iPhone SE (2020) in Recovery Mode</h3><p>You can unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) using Recovery Mode, yourself.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.</p><p>Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="press volume botton"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and unlock Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><h2 id="Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020"><a href="#Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone SE (2020)"></a>Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone SE (2020)</h2><p>If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone SE (2020), you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you’re coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone SE (2020):</p><p>Step 1: Launch Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 3: Enter your passcode.</p><p>Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="turn passcode off"                ></p><p>Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.</p><p>You’re done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone SE (2020) itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-More-information-about-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-mini-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Pro"><a href="#Part-IV-More-information-about-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-mini-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone SE (2020)&#x2F;Apple iPhone SE (2020) mini&#x2F;Apple iPhone SE (2020) Pro"></a>Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone SE (2020)&#x2F;Apple iPhone SE (2020) mini&#x2F;Apple iPhone SE (2020) Pro</h2><p>The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone SE (2020) now.

You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don’t sit up.</p><p><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></p><p>You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) mini.

All Apple iPhone SE (2020) models support Cinematic Mode.</p><p><strong>Water Resistance and Charging</strong></p><p>All Apple iPhone SE (2020) models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone SE (2020) 12 mini was.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>A locked Apple iPhone SE (2020) is never a pretty sight.
