It indicates unauthorized access attempts.</p><ul><li><strong>Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account</strong></li></ul><p>Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion.

Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as “123456” or “password.”</p><ul><li><strong>Length</strong></li></ul><p>Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.</p><p>Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password.

Here's What to Do<p>Forgetting your Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can’t access your data, but it also means you can’t restore your phone if something goes wrong.</p><p>There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you’re having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup password, don’t despair. There are still ways to get it back!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg"                      alt="forget backup password"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 15 Plus is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus" class="headerlink" title="1.

It provides a free and simple method to restore your device. Since it would wipe your data, you might end up losing your essential files in the process. We recommend following this technique only when you have taken a backup of your data via iTunes beforehand. To learn how to wipe a locked iPhone with iTunes, follow these steps:</p><p>1. Firstly, put your Apple iPhone 15 Plus into recovery mode. To do this, launch an updated version of iTunes on your system and connect it to a lightning cable. Now, long-press the Home button on your device and connect it to the other end of the lightning cable. Release the Home button once the iTunes logo would appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14993648422730.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone when locked-boot in recovery mode" title="boot in recovery mode"                ></p><p>2. As soon as your phone would be connected, iTunes will recognize an issue with it. From here, you can choose to restore it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14993648903843.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone when locked-connect to itunes" title="connect to itunes"                ></p><p>3.

From here, choose “Restore backup” under the Backup section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14993649149685.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone when locked-restore backup" title="restore backup"                ></p><p>4. agree to the pop-up message by clicking on the “Restore” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14993649291284.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone when locked-restore iphone" title="restore iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Erase-locked-iPhone-by-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Erase-locked-iPhone-by-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Erase locked iPhone by Find My iPhone"></a>Part 3: Erase locked iPhone by Find My iPhone</h2><p>If you haven’t already taken a backup of your phone, then you might find it hard to recover it with iTunes.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Now, long-press the Home button on your device and connect it to the other end of the lightning cable. Release the Home button once the iTunes logo would appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14993648422730.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone when locked-boot in recovery mode" title="boot in recovery mode"                ></p><p>2.

This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup unlocking never set by you.</p><p>But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let’s talk about them.</p><h2 id="Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.</p><p>One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone"></a>1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 15 Plus backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4.

It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the “iPhone Locked to Owner” scenario can be hard as the fault doesn’t lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device will remain locked to the previous owner’s iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Locked-to-Owner-Security"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-Locked-to-Owner-Security" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 15 Plus Locked to Owner Security"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 15 Plus Locked to Owner Security</h2><p>Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner’s security can be frustrating. That’s why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to <strong><strong>bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus locked to the owner for free</strong></strong>. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-device"><a href="#Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device"></a>Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device</h3><p>If you’ve recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective.

The reason for its success can be clearly seen through its efforts in pioneering top-notch products. It not only puts its efforts into ensuring the perfect working of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device but also provides the user with essential security measures to protect the data of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device from unauthorized access.</p><p>This is the sole reason why Apple focuses so much on privacy through passcodes. But sometimes, these passcodes can be a hurdle in the working of the iPhone.</p><p>If you’re facing this issue, then you’ve come to the right place. This article shall cover your queries regarding fixing the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode that is not working and providing full-depth details for your ease.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-iPhone-is-Saying-Passcode-is-Wrong"><a href="#Part-1-Why-iPhone-is-Saying-Passcode-is-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why iPhone is Saying Passcode is Wrong?"></a>Part 1: Why iPhone is Saying Passcode is Wrong?</h2><p>If you enter the wrong password, your Apple iPhone 15 Plus will not accept it and won’t open your phone. If you repeatedly enter the wrong password, it will disable your phone mainly because of security reasons. However, sometimes you’re genuinely trying to enter the correct password, but your device won’t accept it. This isn’t common, but there are quite a few reasons why iPhone is saying your passcode is wrong.</p><p>Sometimes the problem is trivial, like you may have entered the wrong keys in a hurry, due to which it won’t accept your passcode. In other cases, face recognition may not recognize your face if you’re wearing any mask.</p><p>However, occasionally the problem is technical. Sometimes, your Apple iPhone 15 Plus may be corrupted. This can cause trouble for your device to detect the security file where your passcode is stored. Other times, the operating system may not be installed properly after updating to the new version of iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-iPhone-Passcode-with-Dr-Fone-Without-Losing-Data"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-iPhone-Passcode-with-Dr-Fone-Without-Losing-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove iPhone Passcode with Dr.Fone Without Losing Data"></a>Part 2: Remove iPhone Passcode with Dr.Fone Without Losing Data</h2><p>Everyone in the field of tech is familiar with Wondershare as it is the most innovative and versatile software in the market.

Nonetheless, even the most cutting-edge devices experience occasional setbacks. Among these, one major problem for iPhone users is the “iPhone Unavailable” message. This problem typically arises when many incorrect passcode attempts have locked the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. It renders the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device inaccessible, displaying the “iPhone Unavailable” prompt.</p><p>Yet, worry not, for reliable methods exist to address this problem efficiently. In this guide, we’ll explore the best and proven techniques for <strong>how to fix iPhone unavailable</strong>.

Its primary aim is to protect the data on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and deter unauthorized access.</p><p>The iPhone’s security mechanism typically activates after six wrong attempts.

Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes.

We know forgetting your Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode can be a frustrating experience, but luckily it is possible to unlock your device. Using different methods, we will show you how to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus 6 with a forgotten passcode.</p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode"></a>Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode</h2><p>Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we’ll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My iPhone"></a>1. Use Find My iPhone</h3><p>If you’ve activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn’t require any technical knowledge or special tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg"                      alt="find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus"                ></p><p>Just follow the steps below and get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com&#x2F;find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “All Devices” at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 15 Plus from the list of devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Erase iPhone” and confirm that you want to erase your device.</li></ul><p>Once your Apple iPhone 15 Plus has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes"></a>2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone 15 Plus with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the “Restore” or “Update” appears, please choose “Restore”.</li></ul><p>iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it’s finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Siri"><a href="#3-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Siri"></a>3. Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</li></ul><p>While this method doesn’t give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device’s features.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned methods works for you, or you don’t want to use them, there is another method that will surely work for you. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is a powerful software that can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus without a passcode. The software is extremely easy to use and supports all iOS devices.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone Without Passcode</p><ul><li>Unlock Face ID, Touch ID, Apple ID without password.</li><li>Bypass the iCloud activation lock without hassle.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li><li>Remove iPhone carrier restrictions for unlimited usage.</li><li>No tech knowledge required, Simple, click-through, process.</li></ul><p><strong>3,981,454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h3 id="How-To-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Passcode-Using-Dr-Fone"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Passcode-Using-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock iPhone Without Passcode Using Dr.Fone?"></a>How To Unlock iPhone Without Passcode Using Dr.Fone?</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you have Dr.Fone on your PC, then launch the program and select “Screen Unlock”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-1.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the computer, you require a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Follow the instructions below to put your device in DFU or Recovery mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="dfu mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once your device enters into DFU mode or Recovery mode, Dr.Fone will ask you to choose the right firmware for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus 6.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Upon selecting the right firmware, Dr.Fone will start downloading the firmware for your device. Once it’s finished, click “Unlock Now” to remove the passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="complete firmware"                ></p><p>You need to wait as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don’t interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. Once the process is completed, your Apple iPhone 15 Plus will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="unlock iphone successfully"                ></p><p>This is a very easy-to-use way to reset your Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode. So, if you’re looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should obtain.</p><p>As we told you earlier, any method you follow will lose your data, as there is no way to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus 6 without losing the data.

If you <strong>forgot passcode on iPhone</strong>, Apple’s proper prescribed way is to reset your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. In other words, do a factory reset to erase the passcode.

Keep following us to find out more about our recommended methods.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My"></a>1. Use Find My</h3><p>Utilizing iCloud if the Find My feature is enabled before you <strong>forgot iPhone passcode</strong>. By visiting iCloud.com, you can erase your Apple iPhone 15 Plus from a distance. Moreover, you can eliminate the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s screen lock to unlock it.</p><p>To erase the passcode using the Find My feature on iCloud:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to iCloud.com and enter your Apple account credentials and log in to your account.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pick “Find iPhone” and go to “All Devices” &gt; “Erase iPhone”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="find my"                ></p><h3 id="2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes"></a>2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes</h3><p>How to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 15 Plus in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.</p><p>It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.</p><p>Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won’t be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen’s passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn’t so hard. Here’s how to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode with iTunes:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, iPad, or iPod Contact.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>On iPhone 8&#x2F;8 Or later:</strong> Hold the Power&#x2F;Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus transforms into the recovery mode screen.</li><li><strong>On iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Or Below:</strong> Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</strong></p><p>After connecting your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, “There is an issue with the ‘iPhone name’ that needs it to be restored.” In that window, select “Restore” to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn’t run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up iPhone.</strong></p><p>Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="itunes unlock"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option"><a href="#3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option" class="headerlink" title="3. “Erase iPhone” Option"></a>3. “Erase iPhone” Option</h3><p>However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><p>After several wrong attempts, an “Erase iPhone” choice will appear on the screen’s lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.</p><p>If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device can’t connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 15 Plus cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Siri"><a href="#4-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Siri"></a>4. Use Siri</h3><p>You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

Knowing <strong>how many attempts to unlock an iPhone</strong> is vital due to Apple’s security measures. Exceeding the limit triggers consequences, such as temporary disablement or even data erasure.</p><p>These restrictions highlight the need to learn <strong>how many attempts for iPhone passcodes</strong> are allowed before facing potential data loss. When dealing with failed passcode attempts, exploring methods for successful access is essential. Let’s delve into the intricacies of iPhone passcode security and unveil strategies for a seamless unlocking process.

How Many Times Until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus Is Permanently Disabled?</h2><p>Unlocking an iPhone involves a series of attempts, each with distinct consequences. Here’s a breakdown of <strong>how many failed passcode attempts on an iPhone</strong> you can do before it locks you out:</p><p><strong>First 5 Attempts</strong></p><ul><li>No significant consequences.</li><li>Users have the flexibility to enter their passcode without any penalties.</li></ul><p><strong>6th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>iPhone is disabled for 1 minute.</li><li>An iPhone is Disabled message appears on the screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone is disabled 1 minute"                ></p><p><strong>7th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>Disabled for 5 minutes.</li><li>The same on-screen message persists, but the Apple iPhone 15 Plus enforces a longer wait time.</li></ul><p><strong>8th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>Disabled for 15 minutes.</li><li>Users must wait before attempting again.

Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>This section will introduce you to our most important solution. Yes, you heard it right. If you need a hassle-free method to unlock your iDevice without a passcode or face ID, use Wondershare Dr.Fone Screen Unlock.</p><p>Dr.Fone will not only remove the screen lock but also make sure to keep your identity safe. In addition, it is the easiest method and requires no prior knowledge. So if you are someone new to this technology, we suggest you follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Launch the Software on your PC</strong></p><p>After successfully installing Dr.Fone on your PC, open it and select the “Screen Unlock” tool from the main interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="select screen unlock"                ></p><p>Next, connect your locked phone to the system through a wired connection. Then go for the iOS screen unlock feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="unlock ios screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Recovery or DFU Mode Boot</strong></p><p>It is necessary to first boot your locked device in recovery or DFU mode. Follow the guidelines on your screen to do so. The Recovery mode is the suggested way for iOS screen locks. If you can’t actuate this mode, go for the DFU mode boot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="enter recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Select your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Model</strong></p><p>After the phone is in recovery&#x2F;DFU mode, the program will show the locked device’s information. Here you can see the model and iOS variant of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. If it isn’t correct, you could choose the right one from the dropdown menu next to it. After that, click the Download button to get the required firmware for your locked phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="select phone model"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Remove the Screen Lock</strong></p><p>After downloading the firmware effectively, click the “Unlock Now” button to let Dr.Fone unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="unlock now"                ></p><p>Simply in no time, Dr.Fone will successfully unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This unlocking process will erase everything off your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and bring it to the factory default state. Indeed, no other method that doesn’t allow data erasure at the moment.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcode-or-Face-ID-on-My-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcode-or-Face-ID-on-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn Off Passcode or Face ID on My Device?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn Off Passcode or Face ID on My Device?</h2><p>Face ID can be a helpful method for unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus - by simply looking at your phone. However, a few clients might worry that it’s not as secure as utilizing a PIN to open your phone. If that is the best case for you, you can follow this manual to disable Face ID and depend on a passcode.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step guide to the most effective method to switch off Face ID on the iPhone:</p><h3 id="1-Open-the-Settings-application"><a href="#1-Open-the-Settings-application" class="headerlink" title="1.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

What To Do if Your Home Button Is Broken</h2><p>When faced with a broken iPhone Home button, several quick fixes and solutions can sometimes help. Here are some effective measures before considering professional assistance:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-iphone-without-home-button-14.jpg"                      alt="broken iphone home button"                ></p><p><strong>Recalibrate the Home Button</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> and toggle the <strong>Bold Text</strong> switch. Restart your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, and this may recalibrate the Home button.</p><p><strong>Restore iPhone Firmware</strong></p><p>In extreme cases, restoring the <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html"><u>iPhone firmware</u></a> can resolve Home button issues. Tools like Dr.Fone offer a comprehensive solution to restore firmware and address various lock screen challenges.</p><p><strong>Clean the Home Button</strong></p><p>Dust and debris can affect the Home button’s functionality. Gently clean the area around the button using a small, soft brush or compressed air.</p><p><strong>Use the Charger to Press Against the Home Button</strong></p><p>This unconventional method involves using the charging cable to apply gentle pressure on the Home button. Be cautious to avoid excessive force.</p><p><strong>Visit the Apple Store if Covered by a Warranty</strong></p><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is still under warranty, visiting an Apple Store is advisable. Apple’s warranty covers hardware issues, including malfunctioning Home buttons.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>A broken iPhone Home button need not spell disaster.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why?

It enhances the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s unlocking experience by automatically bypassing the lock screen. That is when certain conditions are met. Jailbreaking involves bypassing the software restrictions imposed by Apple. Here are the steps to <strong>iPhone 11 unlock screen without swiping</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by adding an external repository like Sileo or Cydia, which will serve as an emulator. Remember, it won’t be automatically added to your applications; you’ll need to do this manually. So, download the repository from the <a class="link"   href="https://www.sparkdev.me/" >SparkDev <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website (it’s not available on the App Store). Head to the “Tweaks” tab, find “AutoUnlockX,” and download it to your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Following this, go to “Sources” in your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s Settings, select “Edit,” and manually add the external repo to Cydia or Sileo. Open Sileo or Cydia and navigate to the “Search” page. In the search bar, type “AutoUnlockX.” Once the tweak appears, select it, and then tap “Get (Sileo)” or “Install (Cydia).”</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Confirm the selected repo by tapping the “Confirm” option and allow the tweak to install. Once installed, tap “Restart SpringBoard” to complete the download. After your Apple iPhone 15 Plus resprings, proceed to enable AutoUnlockX.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Open Settings, tap on “App,” and then select “AutoUnlockX.” Toggle on “Enable Auto Unlock.” Customize other settings as desired by tapping on them to turn them on or off.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> When finished, tap the “Respring” option at the bottom to apply your changes. At last, unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus using your Face ID effortlessly.</p><h3 id="Method-5-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-via-Voice-Control"><a href="#Method-5-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-via-Voice-Control" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up via Voice Control"></a>Method 5: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up via Voice Control</h3><p>Utilizing Voice Control to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus offers a hands-free approach to accessing your device. It is especially helpful for individuals with accessibility needs. There are situations where manual interaction might be challenging. Here’s a guide on how to set up and use “Voice Control” to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and scroll down to tap “Accessibility.” On the following screen, press “Voice Control” to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-6.jpg"                      alt="navigate to voice control feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> To set up voice control, you need to ensure that the “Voice Control” option is toggled on. After activating Voice Control, use a voice command to unlock your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-7.jpg"                      alt="toggle on voice control option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-6-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-with-Switch-Control"><a href="#Method-6-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-with-Switch-Control" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up with Switch Control"></a>Method 6: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up with Switch Control</h3><p>Utilizing Switch Control is an excellent accessibility feature on iOS devices. It allows users to interact with their iPhones using adaptive switches or the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s screen itself. Moreover, it can provide an alternative way to navigate the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and access the Home screen. You no longer have to rely solely on the conventional swipe gesture. Here is how you can set up switch control to <strong>iPhone swipe to unlock</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s Settings, then tap on “Accessibility.” Now find and select “Switch Control,” and within it, navigate to “Switches.” Now, tap “Add New Switch” and choose “Camera.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-8.jpg"                      alt="add a new switch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Set Left Head Movement and Right Head Movement separately to “Home.” This action will lock the screen when tilting your head left or right. Now go back to “Recipes” in Switch Control, select “Edit,” and delete all existing recipes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-9.jpg"                      alt="remove existing recipes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set “Scanning Style” to “Single Switch Step Scanning” and adjust “Dwell Time” to the shortest duration. Then, turn off the remaining settings under Switch Control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-10.jpg"                      alt="reduce dwell time as needed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Save your switch, return to Accessibility Settings, and locate “Accessibility Shortcut.” Now, set triple-clicking the side button to activate “Switch Control.” On the home screen, triple-click the Side button, as previously set, to activate the switch on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. Now, lock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus screen and then wake the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device without looking at it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-11.jpg"                      alt="set switch control as accessibility shortcut"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, we have explored different ways to <strong>unlock iPhones without swiping up</strong> beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We’ve talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.</p><p>While these methods are helpful, there’s a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that’s particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can’t get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called “Screen Unlock” that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-obs-livestream-integration-for-maximum-facebook-reach/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating OBS Livestream Integration for Maximum Facebook Reach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-top-12-interactive-pc-adventures-to-boost-your-clicking/"><u>[New] Top 12 Interactive PC Adventures to Boost Your Clicking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-exploring-the-magic-behind-color-grading-with-luts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Exploring the Magic Behind Color Grading with LUTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-the-power-of-closed-captions-on-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlocking the Power of Closed Captions on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-perfectly-log-off-video-conferencing-on-devices-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Perfectly Log-Off Video Conferencing on Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-instantaneous-window-imaging-technique/"><u>[Updated] Instantaneous Window Imaging Technique</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expertly-ranked-online-capturing-software/"><u>2024 Approved  Expertly Ranked Online Capturing Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/complete-fixes-to-solve-apple-iphone-6-randomly-asking-for-apple-id-password-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Complete Fixes To Solve Apple iPhone 6 Randomly Asking for Apple ID Password | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/different-methods-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-14-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Different Methods To Unlock Your Apple iPhone 14 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/different-methods-to-unlock-your-iphone-11-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Different Methods To Unlock Your iPhone 11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-unlocked-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Everything You Need To Know About Unlocked Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-unlock-apple-iphone-12-with-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Full Guide to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 with iTunes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-flashlight-from-iphone-12-mini-lock-screen-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone 12 mini Lock Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-find-my-apple-iphone-13-mini-when-phone-is-broken-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini when Phone is Broken? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-6-plus-with-an-apple-watch-and-what-to-do-if-it-doesnt-work-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock iPhone 6 Plus With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesnt Work | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-erase-apple-iphone-6s-plus-when-its-locked-within-seconds-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Erase Apple iPhone 6s Plus When Its Locked Within Seconds | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-iphone-14-plus-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Apple iPhone 14 Plus Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-disabling-iphone-14-parental-restrictions-withwithout-password-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Disabling iPhone 14 Parental Restrictions With/Without Password | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-steps-on-how-to-create-a-new-apple-id-account-on-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Easy Steps on How To Create a New Apple ID Account On Apple iPhone 12 mini | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-iphone-passcode-again-unlock-iphone-15-pro-without-passcode-now-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Forgot iPhone Passcode Again?
