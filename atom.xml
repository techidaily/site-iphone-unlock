It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.</p><p>It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the <strong>Apple Store “Verification Required”</strong> prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg"                      alt="verification required page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?</h2><p>When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.</p><p>The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.</p><p>What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html"><u>Touch ID</u></a> if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg"                      alt="verification required notification"                ></p><h3 id="Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear"><a href="#Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear"></a>Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear</h3><p>There are several reasons why you might see an <strong>Apple Store’ Verification</strong> <strong>Required</strong>’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:</p><ul><li><strong>New Apple ID</strong>. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.</li><li><strong>Unpaid balance</strong>. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.</li></ul><p>Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID</h2><p>Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game.

Here’s how to tackle it:</p><h3 id="Update-Payment-Method"><a href="#Update-Payment-Method" class="headerlink" title="Update Payment Method"></a>Update Payment Method</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the <strong>Settings app</strong>, then go to <strong>Payment &amp; Shipping</strong>. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.</p><h3 id="Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions"><a href="#Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions" class="headerlink" title="Check Unpaid Subscriptions"></a>Check Unpaid Subscriptions</h3><p>Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt.

Go to Settings, then to <strong>Screen Time</strong>. Under <strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong>, select <strong>iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases</strong>. Here, you can change the settings to <strong>Don’t Require</strong> for purchases.

Follow these steps to potentially resolve the issue once and for all by accessing the respective settings:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> You begin by accessing your iDevice’s “Settings” app and scrolling down to tap the “Mail” option. Next, press “Accounts,” and on the following screen, select the Outlook account.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-2.jpg"                      alt="head to mail accounts in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Encountering the error message “Account not authenticated” is what you will come across.

Change the Password to Your Outlook Mail"></a>Fix 2. Change the Password to Your Outlook Mail</h3><p>Sometimes, the email service provider may force users to change their passwords for security reasons. There is a chance that it is why your <strong>iPhone asks for an Outlook password</strong>. To modify your Outlook password from the desktop platform, adhere to the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open your preferred web browser and go to the Outlook login page. Sign in to your Outlook account, locate, and click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner. There, click “My Profile,” and on the next screen, tap “Change Password” near the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-4.jpg"                      alt="access my profile outlook web"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Upon reaching the verification page, provide your password and tap the “Sign In” button. Afterward, you will be asked for other verification methods. Upon verifying, the “Change your password” window will appear. Here, you will need to enter your “Current password,” “New password,” and re-enter it to proceed. Then, hit the “Save” button, and your password will be changed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-5.jpg"                      alt="enter outlook password and save it"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Checking-the-Network-Connection"><a href="#Fix-3-Checking-the-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection"></a>Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection</h3><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html"><u>Network inconsistencies</u></a> can often disrupt the authentication process. This can be the leading cause behind persistent password prompts. To ensure a stable connection, ensure that you are connected to a reliable and stable Wi-Fi network. You can also try toggling the Wi-Fi and mobile data switches on and off.</p><p>Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-6.jpg"                      alt="check network iphone settings"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Using-the-Mail-Toggle-as-a-Remedy"><a href="#Fix-4-Using-the-Mail-Toggle-as-a-Remedy" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4. Using the Mail Toggle as a Remedy"></a>Fix 4. Using the Mail Toggle as a Remedy</h3><p>A strategic approach to resolving authentication issues involves using the Mail toggle.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 12 Pro based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 12 Pro from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, making it unusable.

Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is restricted and doesn’t support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is locked or not:</p><h3 id="Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings"><a href="#Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings"></a>Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings</h3><p>To check whether your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, open your Apple iPhone 12 Pro “Settings” and tap the “General” option.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Launch the Software on your PC</strong></p><p>After successfully installing Dr.Fone on your PC, open it and select the “Screen Unlock” tool from the main interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="select screen unlock"                ></p><p>Next, connect your locked phone to the system through a wired connection. Then go for the iOS screen unlock feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="unlock ios screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Recovery or DFU Mode Boot</strong></p><p>It is necessary to first boot your locked device in recovery or DFU mode. Follow the guidelines on your screen to do so. The Recovery mode is the suggested way for iOS screen locks. If you can’t actuate this mode, go for the DFU mode boot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="enter recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Select your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Model</strong></p><p>After the phone is in recovery&#x2F;DFU mode, the program will show the locked device’s information. Here you can see the model and iOS variant of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device. If it isn’t correct, you could choose the right one from the dropdown menu next to it. After that, click the Download button to get the required firmware for your locked phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="select phone model"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Remove the Screen Lock</strong></p><p>After downloading the firmware effectively, click the “Unlock Now” button to let Dr.Fone unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="unlock now"                ></p><p>Simply in no time, Dr.Fone will successfully unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This unlocking process will erase everything off your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and bring it to the factory default state. Indeed, no other method that doesn’t allow data erasure at the moment.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcode-or-Face-ID-on-My-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcode-or-Face-ID-on-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn Off Passcode or Face ID on My Device?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn Off Passcode or Face ID on My Device?</h2><p>Face ID can be a helpful method for unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max - by simply looking at your phone. However, a few clients might worry that it’s not as secure as utilizing a PIN to open your phone. If that is the best case for you, you can follow this manual to disable Face ID and depend on a passcode.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step guide to the most effective method to switch off Face ID on the iPhone:</p><h3 id="1-Open-the-Settings-application"><a href="#1-Open-the-Settings-application" class="headerlink" title="1. Open the Settings application"></a>1. Open the Settings application</h3><p>First, tap on your Settings app to open it. That is the one on the home screen with a symbol like the mechanical gear.</p><h3 id="2-Tap-on-Face-ID-and-Passcode"><a href="#2-Tap-on-Face-ID-and-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="2. Tap on Face ID and Passcode"></a>2. Tap on Face ID and Passcode</h3><p>On the Settings menu, tap on the Face ID and Passcode menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-6.jpg"                      alt="passcode menu"                ></p><h3 id="3-Enter-your-passcode"><a href="#3-Enter-your-passcode" class="headerlink" title="3. Enter your passcode"></a>3. Enter your passcode</h3><p>At this stage, you’ll be approached to enter your passcode, so do this to get to the Face ID and Passcode menu.</p><h3 id="4-Switch-off-Face-ID"><a href="#4-Switch-off-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="4. Switch off Face ID"></a>4. Switch off Face ID</h3><p>You’ll have the option to turn off the switch for Face ID across different activities, including the phone unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-7.jpg"                      alt="turn off passcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-bypass-my-iPhone-Face-ID-with-a-picture"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-bypass-my-iPhone-Face-ID-with-a-picture" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?"></a>Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?</h2><p>As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.</p><p>FaceID isn’t simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

Wait for a while as it will reset your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max remotely.</p><p>As you can see, the Find my iPhone service was majorly introduced to discover the location of a lost iOS device. Though, you can use it to ring your device or erase it remotely as well. In this way, you can learn how to unlock iPhone 5 passcode without computer. The technique can also be implemented in other iPhone versions like Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, 6 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and more.</p><p>Attention: All your data will be erased while you are unlocking with this tool.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Intuitive instructions to unlock iPhone without the passcode.</li><li>Removes the iPhone’s lock screen whenever it is disabled.</li><li>Works for all models of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.</li><li>Fully compatible with the latest iOS 11.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SG-KuuduzaY"></iframe><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-passcode-without-computer-using-Siri-bug"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-passcode-without-computer-using-Siri-bug" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode without computer using Siri bug?"></a>Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode without computer using Siri bug?</h2><p>This might surprise you, but there is a loophole in Siri that can be exploited to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device.

It will then create a backup.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Restore</strong></p><p>Once your device is synced with iTunes, a “Set Up” window will pop up on the screen displaying two options, “Restore” or “Update.” Select “Restore” to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/06/iphone-passcode-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone with itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Reset Passcode</strong></p><p>Select your device and the appropriate backup for your device in iTunes. Once the process is completed, you can reset the passcode of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max in the settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/06/iphone-passcode-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restore backup in itunes"                ></p><h3 id="3-2-Apple-iCloud-Feature"><a href="#3-2-Apple-iCloud-Feature" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Apple iCloud Feature"></a>3.2 Apple iCloud Feature</h3><p>iCloud is a multifunctional drive compatible with iOS and macOS. It saves your data, your media and organizes your files in folders. Moreover, it allows the user to share media, data, files, and even location with the other iPhone&#x2F;iOS user. The major feature of Apple iCloud is its ‘Backup’ which stores all your data in case you lose or damage your phone.</p><p>To fix the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode, which is not working, iCloud can come in handy. But this method can only work if you’ve logged in to your iCloud account on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and your “Find My iPhone” application is turned on. All you have to do is erase your data which will automatically erase your passcode through iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign in with Apple ID</strong></p><p>First, open iCloud.com on another iOS and write your credentials to sign in your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Select your Device</strong></p><p>Click on “Find My iPhone” and select “All devices,” and a list of devices will come up which are working under the same Apple ID. Select your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/06/iphone-passcode-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="select iphone on icloud"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Erase Data and Set up your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.</strong></p><p>Now click on the option of “Erase iPhone” to erase all your data and even your passcode.

Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max? And now, you want to disable the Face ID. Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn <strong>how to remove Face ID</strong> on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-I-What-is-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-I-What-is-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: What is Face ID?"></a>Part I: What is Face ID?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><p>If the new Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from the 6&#x2F;7&#x2F;8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.</p><p>Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max 13, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max 14, and now the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.</p><p>Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.</p><h2 id="Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?"></a>Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?</h2><p>Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode.

In this case, we strongly suggest you use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is a reliable tool and has been in the market for a long time. Professional unlock service providers use it because of its ease of use and clean interface.</p><p>So, without looking any further, download this tool for a remarkable unlocking experience. The methods below will guide you into unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 Pro within no time:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone software and tap the “Unlock iOS Screen.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery&#x2F;DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before bypassing the Apple iPhone 13 Pro lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen guidelines. The Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. However, if you can’t activate the Recovery mode, you can figure out how to activate the DFU mode from their official site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Affirm Device Information</strong></p><p>After getting the phone in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro model and other data. You can choose the right information from the dropdown menu if the information isn’t right. Then, at that point, download the firmware for your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="device information"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Screen Lock</strong></p><p>After downloading the required firmware effectively, click Unlock Now to remove the lock. However, note that this unlocking system will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro. Truly, there is no answer for <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock</strong> without losing your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="unlocked successfully"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>You might forget the password used before placing your Apple iPhone 13 Pro in Lost Mode.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Also, you don’t need to bother with any technical information. Users can now unlock their iPhones through the Erase iPhone, Find My, and Siri. Even if these methods don’t work in your situation, you can employ other professional tools. One such tool is Dr.Fone.</p><p>Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock by Wondershare is an expert tool to remove such issues. It is a safe method for everyone new to the technical world. The process is basic, assuming you follow the step-by-step guide below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Methods-to-Unlock-Disabled-iPhone-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-2-3-Methods-to-Unlock-Disabled-iPhone-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 3 Methods to Unlock Disabled iPhone without a computer?"></a>Part 2: 3 Methods to Unlock Disabled iPhone without a computer?</h2><h3 id="1-“Erase-iPhone”-Option"><a href="#1-“Erase-iPhone”-Option" class="headerlink" title="1. “Erase iPhone” Option"></a>1. “Erase iPhone” Option</h3><p>You want to use this method when you fail to remember your Apple iPhone 6 Plus PIN. It is the most straightforward method for opening your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, assuming you forgot your password.</p><p>Since iOS 15.2, Apple presented an “Erase iPhone” choice from the Security Lockout window. This window appears from the seventh time you enter an incorrect code. The steps beneath work if your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad runs iOS 15.2 or later and has an internet connection:</p><ul><li>When you don’t know the lock screen PIN, please enter your password several times from your Lock Screen until it warns you the next time. Then do this step again until you see the Erase iPhone toward the side of the screen.</li><li>Tap Erase iPhone, then click again to affirm your action.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-passcode-without-computer-1.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><ul><li>Enter your Apple account credentials to sign out of your Apple ID on the phone.</li><li>Tap Erase iPhone back to erase all your files and settings forever.</li><li>Right when the phone restarts, comply with the on-screen steps. Yet again, set your phone, and restore your information and settings from a backup. Presently set another password for your phone.</li></ul><p><strong>Guidelines to Restore a Locked iPhone Running iOS 15.1 or Earlier:</strong></p><ul><li>Regardless, put your Apple iPhone 6 Plus into DFU mode.</li><li>Then, connect it to a PC or Mac through a Lightning USB.</li><li>Tap your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in the Finder sidebar on Macintosh or iTunes on the PC.</li><li>Pick Restore when you see the decision to Restore. Let the download finish, and your phone leaves the recovery mode screen. Yet again, then switch off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and begin.</li><li>Disconnect your iDevice, then turn it on and set it up. That is all you must do.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-Find-My"><a href="#2-Use-Find-My" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Find My"></a>2. Use Find My</h3><p>Apple permits clients to erase iPhone data to protect it from others remotely. Nonetheless, your lock screen can save your data if you don’t erase the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device.

You can use the following steps to lock apps using FamiSafe:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install FamiSafe and FamiSafe Jr on Respective Devices</strong></p><p>Get FamiSafe from the App Store and log in using your Wondershare ID or your Apple, Google, or Facebook account. Select the parent mode and link your child’s phone by installing FamiSafe Jr on their devices using either the QR code or the pairing code. Once the pairing is done, input details about your children and allow FamiSafe Jr to oversee their devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="download the famisafe apps"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Provide the Necessary Permissions to FamiSafe</strong></p><p>Now, activate Accessibility for FamiSafe by accessing “Settings,” tapping “FamiSafe,” and enabling “Location.” Then, grant access to the Apple iPhone 7 device’s photos, microphone, and motion &amp; fitness activity. Now, use a computer and connect your child’s device with a USB cable. Activate content blockers in Safari to prevent kids from accessing inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-10.jpg"                      alt="enable the content blockers"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Connect the Kid’s Device to the Computer</strong></p><p>To do that, access “Safari” in “Settings” and move to”Content Blockers” to enable FamiSafe. To get started, connect your kids’ iOS devices to your PC. Once connected, navigate to the main interface and select “Features” located at the bottom. This will display available features, and you can proceed by tapping on “App Blocker.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-11.jpg"                      alt="select the app blocker feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Block Any App Using the App Blocker Feature</strong></p><p>Establish the connection between your kids’ iOS devices and your PC by pairing them with your phone.

Lock apps onApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPad using App Locker"></a>2. Lock apps onApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPad using App Locker</h3><p>Besides the native iPhone app lock solutions, you can also take the assistance of a third-party tool. However, most of these apps only support jailbroken devices. Therefore, if you wish to use a dedicated app lock for your Apple iPhone 7, then you need to jailbreak your device. Needless to say, getting your device jailbroken has its perks and demerits. If you don’t want to jailbreak your device, then you can simply take the assistance of the above-mentioned solutions.</p><p>However, if you have a jailbroken device and would like to app lock the iPhone, then you can also use AppLocker. It is available at Cydia’s repository and can be purchased for just $0.99. It can be installed on your jailbroken device to get an added level of security. Not just apps, it can also be used to lock certain settings, folders, accessibilities, and more. To learn how to lock apps on iPhone using AppLocker, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, get AppLocker on your device from <a class="link"   href="http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker" >http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. As of now, it works on iOS 6 to 10 versions.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After installing the tweak, you can go to Settings &gt; Applocker to access it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136509845.jpg"                      alt="iphone applocker"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> To access the feature, make sure that you have “<strong>Enabled</strong>” it (by turning it on).</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This will let you set up a passcode to lock the apps and settings of your choice.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> To app lock, the iPhone, visit the “<strong>Application Locking</strong>” feature on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136826933.jpg"                      alt="application locking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> From here, you can turn on (or off) the locking feature for apps of your choice.</p><p>This will let your app lock the Apple iPhone 7 without any trouble. You can also go to the “Reset Password Phrase” to change the passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Lock-Apps-onApple-iPhone-7-iPad-using-BioProtect"><a href="#3-Lock-Apps-onApple-iPhone-7-iPad-using-BioProtect" class="headerlink" title="3. Lock Apps onApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPad using BioProtect"></a>3. Lock Apps onApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPad using BioProtect</h3><p>Just like Applocker, BioProtect is another third-party tool that works only on jailbroken devices. It can also be downloaded from Cydia’s repository. Apart from apps, you can also use BioProtect to lock settings, SIM features, folders, and more. It is linked to the Touch ID of the Apple iPhone 7 device and scans the fingerprint of a user to grant (or deny) access to any app. The app only works on iPhone 5s and later devices, having a Touch ID. However, you can also set a passcode as well if your Touch ID is not working. To use the BioProtect app lock for iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, get the BioProtect app to lock iPhone on your device from the right <a class="link"   href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/net.limneos.bioprotect/" >http://cydia.saurik.com/package/net.limneos.bioprotect/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> To access the tweak’s panel, you need to provide your fingerprint access.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Place your finger on your Touch ID and match its print.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137022586.jpg"                      alt="app is locked"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This will let you access the BioProtect app settings.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Firstly, enable the app by turning the respective feature on.</p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Under the “<strong>Protected Applications</strong>” section, you can see a list of all the major apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137256044.jpg"                      alt="protected applications"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Simply turn on (or off) the feature of the app that you wish to lock.</p><p><strong>Step 8.</strong> You can also go to the “Touch ID” feature to further calibrate the app.</p><p><strong>Step 9.</strong> After setting the lock, you would be asked to authenticate using your fingerprint to access the protected app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137676497.jpg"                      alt="authenticate using fingerprint"                ></p><h3 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h3><p>By following these solutions, you would be able to learn how to lock apps on the Apple iPhone 7 without much trouble. We have provided both, third-party as well as native solutions to app lock the Apple iPhone 7 in a secure manner.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.</p><p>Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone. Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value. Talking about iPhone, let’s discuss how a user can unlock Apple iPhone 8 Plus without a passcode.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn6H3w08kAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus-without-Passcode-or-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus-without-Passcode-or-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Unlock Disabled iPhone 12 by Erasing iPhone in iCloud</strong></h2><p>IOS world is different from the Android world, and so, both have different and unique problems to deal with. For example, an android user can never imagine unlocking a disabled phone, but iPhone users surely know how to do it. It might be possible that someone doesn’t know how they can erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus from iCloud, so for such users, let’s provide a step-by-step guideline;</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, the user is requested to visit icloud.com on your computer or any other device that is in use. Then log in by using the Apple ID and password.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/unlock-iphone-12-or-12-pro-max-3.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone 12 or 12 pro max"                ></p></li><li><p>If two-factor authentication is enabled on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, then hit ‘Trust’ and enter the 6-digit verification code that will be sent to your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.</p></li><li><p>Once you are logged in, choose ‘Find iPhone’ and enter your Apple ID and password again.</p></li><li><p>4.

The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone X’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.</p><p>However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.</p><p>With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone X’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.</p><p>Moreover, you might be able to <strong>use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone X</strong>.</p><p>Now, you cannot just <strong>unlock any Apple iPhone X with your Watch</strong>. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Here’s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Use-an-Apple-Watch-To-Unlock-My-Apple-iPhone-X"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Use-an-Apple-Watch-To-Unlock-My-Apple-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.</p><p>With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.</p><p>The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.</p><p>What could work is your Apple Watch.</p><p>Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone X model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone X and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone X and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone X to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone X in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone X device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone X device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

Once the process is completed, your Apple iPhone X will be unlocked.</li></ol><p>Now, set up your Apple iPhone X, and you are good to go.</p><p><strong>Unlock iPhone 8 and Update Models in Recovery Mode</strong></p><p>The process of unlocking an iPhone 8 or newer model differs from the older models.

The steps below can help you quickly resolve the <strong>“I found my lost iPhone how do I unlock it”</strong> query:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1. Install Dr.Fone and Access the Built-In Toolbox</strong></li></ul><p>After installing Wondershare Dr.Fone, launch and navigate to the “Toolbox” section from the left panel. Continue to select “Screen Unlock” and continue by choosing “iOS” as the Apple iPhone 13 device type.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="proceed with screen unlock feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2. Start Unlocking iOS Screen Lock</strong></li></ul><p>From the available features, proceed with “Unlock iOS Screen” and click “Start” to initiate the unlocking process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-2.png"                      alt="choose unlock ios screen option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3. Put iOS Into Recovery Mode and Specify Details</strong></li></ul><p>Moving on, you must put your iOS device into Recovery Mode. For this, follow the instructions on the screen based on your Apple iPhone 13 model. Once it is in Recovery Mode successfully, you need to verify the Apple iPhone 13 device details. Verify the “Device Model,” select the specific “System Version,” and continue to device unlocking by clicking “Start.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="select device model and version"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4. Confirm the Unlocking Process and Successfully Execute</strong></li></ul><p>As the respective iOS firmware downloads, wait a few minutes and press the “Unlock” button. A prompt window appears where you have to enter the code “00000” to confirm the screen unlocking process. Once the iOS unlocking process is concluded, tap the “Done” button to check if you can access your Apple iPhone 13.

[Old Ways] Using Siri To Unlock Stolen iPhone"></a>Part 2. [Old Ways] Using Siri To Unlock Stolen iPhone</h2><p>It might come as a surprise to you that Siri can be used to unlock a lost iPhone. When you seek the answer to <strong>how to unlock a lost iPhone</strong> with Siri, you need to be aware of a very specific pointer. It is necessary to note that this method only works for devices operating between iOS 8 and 11.</p><p>This later turned out to be an anomaly in Siri that led users to unlock their iOS devices. If you have a device running within this iOS version range, learn how to unlock it with the provided steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Start by activating the Siri on your iOS device. Ask a simple question about time, like “What time is it?” Once Siri is active, a clock will display on your device screen. Next, access the clock and find the “World Clock” screen on your Apple iPhone 13. Tap the “+” button at the screen’s top right corner. Enter the name of any city in the “Search Bar,” tap Select All, and choose “Share.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="access world clocks via siri"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the sharing options, look for “Messages.” As you access the next screen, type anything in the “To” section and continue to select it by navigating to the “Create a New Contact” option. When providing the contact details, tap the “Add Photo” button. Lead into the Photos app from there and swipe up the screen or press the “Home” button to access the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="access photos app to unlock"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-All-Data-Lost-Trying-Recovery-Mode-for-Unlocking-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-All-Data-Lost-Trying-Recovery-Mode-for-Unlocking-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. [All Data Lost] Trying Recovery Mode for Unlocking Stolen iPhone"></a>Part 3. [All Data Lost] Trying Recovery Mode for Unlocking Stolen iPhone</h2><p>Another lifesaver method to unlock stolen iPhones is by utilizing the Recovery Mode. For this purpose, users need to connect their iPhones to their PC using <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" >iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Its ability to facilitate data restoration makes it an effective method to unlock iOS devices. Rather than searching for “<strong>I bought a lost iPhone how do I unlock it</strong>,” simply follow the instructions below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Connect your locked stolen Apple iPhone 13 to the computer using a USB cable. To enter the Recovery Mode, you need to follow the steps below, depending on your Apple iPhone 13 model:</p></li><li><p><strong>For iPhone 8 and Later:</strong> Press and release the “Volume Up” button, followed by the “Volume Down” button.

Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 13 device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation.

That is because the Apple iPhone 13 device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 13 device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 13  activation lock.
