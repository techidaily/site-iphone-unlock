If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That’s because protecting the original owner’s data and privacy is essential.</li><li>**Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn’t pay their bills.

It’s like your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is suddenly mute.</li><li>**No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will be like a disconnected island.</li><li>**Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, its value will drop if it’s blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.</li></ul><p>So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities.

How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free"></a>Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free</h2><p>Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let’s talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max free. The good news is there’s a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklist removal"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal"><a href="#What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal" class="headerlink" title="What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?"></a>What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?</h3><p>Going through a <strong>blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> is like giving your device a second chance. It’s taking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

However, this may be easier said than done.

If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode.

You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option.

Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option.

If there are inconsistencies or conflicts with the iCloud Keychain data, it may prompt you to verify your Apple ID password.</p><ul><li><strong>Network Connectivity****：</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, network connectivity issues can cause the Apple ID password prompts to appear repeatedly. If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is struggling to establish a stable internet connection, it may trigger verification prompts.</p><p>These are some of the common causes that can trigger the <strong>random Apple ID verification pop-up</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1494880/17238" target="_top" id="1494880"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1494880"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1494880/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="II.III Put The Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in Recovery Mode"></a>II.III Put The Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in Recovery Mode</h3><p>You can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using Recovery Mode, yourself.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the computer and open iTunes.

If we enter it incorrectly a few times in succession, the phone will disable itself to prevent unauthorized access. It can seem like the end of the world because in so many ways smartphones have become our world. Here are ways you can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max disabled due to too many incorrect passcode attempts.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Without-iTunes-iCloud-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Without-iTunes-iCloud-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without iTunes&#x2F; iCloud Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Part 1: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without iTunes&#x2F; iCloud Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h2><p>We know and understand that the word troubleshooting can remind you of long telephone calls with support or making appointments and driving down to specialists and spending obscene amounts of money to get solutions.

If for any reason the phone does not boot in Recovery Mode, there are instructions provided at the bottom to enter what is called DFU mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="device page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone will read and display your phone model and the software installed on it. If the model displayed is incorrect, use the dropdown to pick the correct detail. Click “Start” to download the specific firmware file for your particular Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="download firmware"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After the download completes, please click Unlock Now to start unlocking the disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="start unlock"                ></p><p>Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will be unlocked in a short span of time. Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. When you set the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device up again, if you set it to use iCloud, data such as Contacts, iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive data, etc. will be downloaded onto your device again. The apps you had on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder"><a href="#Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iTunes or macOS Finder"></a>Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iTunes or macOS Finder</h2><p>Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to a Windows&#x2F; macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn’t require going through complex hoops.</p><p>Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 1: Visit <em><a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> and log in into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my iphone"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max remotely and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max once again.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App"><a href="#Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App"></a>Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App</h2><p>There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. This method is particularly useful if you’re traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="find my on macos"                ></p><p>Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices from the left pane, click&#x2F; tap your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and click&#x2F; tap Erase This Device</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Without-A-Computer"><a href="#Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Without-A-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without A Computer"></a>Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without A Computer</h2><p>There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and return the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Unlock-Stolen-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-In-Different-Conditionsin"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-Stolen-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-In-Different-Conditionsin" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock Stolen Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max In Different Conditionsin"></a>How To Unlock Stolen Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max In Different Conditionsin</h2><p>Whenever your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max gets stolen, multiple concerns involve accessing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and stored data.

Just sign out of all Apple services and devices that use your account first.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/"><u>Apple ID</u></a> official website and log in to your account credentials.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-03.jpg"                      alt="apple id website interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once logged in, select <strong>Apple ID</strong> in the <strong>Sign-In and Security</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-04.jpg"                      alt="apple id sign in and security"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the <strong>Apple ID</strong> pop-up window, enter your new Apple ID in the <strong>Change your Apple ID</strong> text field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-05.jpg"                      alt="enter a new apple id interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select <strong>Change Apple ID</strong> to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check your email to get a verification code sent by Apple to ensure that only you can change it to a third-party email address.

It’s possible, but it depends on your location, how you created your account, and what version of iOS you’re using.</p><p>If you’re in China mainland or India, and you’re using iOS 11 or later, you can create a new Apple ID with Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max number as the username. However, Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max number must be (+86) or (+91). So, if you’re thinking of, “<strong>How can I change my Apple ID on my iPad</strong> if it’s a mobile phone number?” then this guide is for you:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log out of all Apple services and devices currently signed in with your Apple ID, except the one you’re using to change your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On your iPad, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>[your account name]</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign-in &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Edit</strong> next to <strong>Email &amp; Phone Numbers</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-06.jpg"                      alt="click edit on iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to the <strong>Delete</strong> icon next to your mobile number and follow the directions given.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter the code sent to the mobile number you added as your new Apple ID to verify it.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Log into all Apple services using your new Apple ID.</li></ul><p>Even if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to a mobile phone number, you can still associate it with a phone number on your account page. It means you can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/apple-account/how-to-remove-phone-number-from-apple-id.html"><u>use a different email address or mobile phone number to log in to your Apple ID</u></a>.

However, there can be setbacks during the process. Now, here’s what to do if you find yourself unable to do it and why it might be happening:</p><p>Try Again Later</p><p>If you encounter errors during the process, give it a little time and try again. Mayne it is because you <strong>changed your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to an iCloud email address within 30 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-07.jpg"                      alt="change apple id to icloud email"                ></p><p>Check if Apple ID Is Already in Use</p><p>Apple IDs are unique, and you can’t have two identical ones. If you’re trying to change your Apple ID to one that’s already in use, you’ll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn’t already taken. Remove it from the family member’s account if they are using it.</p><p>Your Apple ID Is an Email Address</p><p>If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won’t be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.</p><p>If you’ve addressed these issues and still can’t change your Apple ID, don’t worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges. Contact them for guidance and solutions tailored to your situation.</p><p>However, if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> because you forgot or don’t have access to the password, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone. This tool is easy to use and can help you unlock your iPad and remove the Apple ID in a few clicks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Using Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Part 4: Using <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></h2><p>Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) tool is your go-to solution for unlocking iOS devices without a passcode.

Read on and learn how to unlock the disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without a computer right away.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8CJ89bh90c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-unlock-disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-without-computer-using-Siri"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-unlock-disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-without-computer-using-Siri" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without computer using Siri?"></a>Part 1: How to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without computer using Siri?</h2><p>Accessing Siri is the first thing that comes to iOS users’ minds whenever they <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/get-into-locked-iphone.html" >get locked out of their Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It might surprise you, but you can also take the assistance of Siri to unlock your phone. Most users prefer this technique, as it doesn’t require a computer and can unlock an iOS device without erasing its data.</p><p>Though, before you proceed, you need to know the limitations of this method. Since it is considered a loophole in iOS, it doesn’t always yield desirable results. It has been observed that the method only works on devices running from iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. To learn how to unlock iPad passcode without a computer, follow these stepwise instructions:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Activate Siri on your iOS device by holding the Home button. Ask for the present time by giving a command like “Hey Siri, what time is it?” to proceed. Siri will let you know the current time by displaying a clock. Tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463688829.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Tap on the Add (plus) icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463891817.jpg"                      alt="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From here, you can search for a city.

This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg"                      alt="use find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to unlock iphone 13 without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the ‘Find My iPhone’ option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select the ‘All Devices’ option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from the list of devices.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click the ‘Erase’ option to confirm your action.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.</p><h3 id="Unlock-it-with-iTunes"><a href="#Unlock-it-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Unlock it with iTunes"></a>Unlock it with iTunes</h3><p>Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven’t done that, this method won’t work. Here’s how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once recognized, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will appear in the iTunes window.

From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.</p><p>Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don’t have to stress the next time you can’t log in to your account.</p><ol><li>Turn on “AutoFill” in “Settings”</li></ol><p>You can turn on <strong>AutoFill</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you’ve entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will save the information, so you don’t have to enter it again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg"                      alt="autofill"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords</li></ol><p>iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you’ve turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><ol start="3"><li>Use Notes for passwords</li></ol><p>If you’re finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it “Passwords.” Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.</p><p>You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it’s for.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone’s notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.</p><p>However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can’t even conceive.

This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password.

This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1.

In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup.

How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4.

To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:</p><h3 id="1-Check-Device-Eligibility"><a href="#1-Check-Device-Eligibility" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Device Eligibility"></a>1. Check Device Eligibility</h3><p>Make sure your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.</p><h3 id="2-Backup-Your-Data"><a href="#2-Backup-Your-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Backup Your Data"></a>2. Backup Your Data</h3><p>Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.</p><p>If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.</p><h3 id="3-Understand-Terms-and-Conditions"><a href="#3-Understand-Terms-and-Conditions" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand Terms and Conditions"></a>3. Understand Terms and Conditions</h3><p>Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud’s Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s data.</p><p>Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.</p><h3 id="4-Follow-Instructions-Carefully"><a href="#4-Follow-Instructions-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="4.

Troubleshooting Common Issues"></a>5. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn’t been unlocked during this time.</p><p>When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the computer.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max can be daunting when you’ve forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues.

As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-X-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-X-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from being unlocked by thieves"></a>Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from being unlocked by thieves</h2><p>It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

The best way to avoid this scenario is by taking a regular backup of your data. You can either backup your data on iCloud, via iTunes, or by using any third-party tool as well. In this way, you won’t be able to lose your important files while unlocking your device’s passcode.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now when you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode without iTunes, you can easily access your device.

Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg"                      alt="use find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to unlock iphone 13 without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the ‘Find My iPhone’ option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select the ‘All Devices’ option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from the list of devices.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click the ‘Erase’ option to confirm your action.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.</p><h3 id="Unlock-it-with-iTunes"><a href="#Unlock-it-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Unlock it with iTunes"></a>Unlock it with iTunes</h3><p>Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven’t done that, this method won’t work. Here’s how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once recognized, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the ‘Summary’ option present in the left sidebar.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, click on the ‘Restore iPhone’ button in the right sidebar.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.</p><h3 id="Unlock-iPhone-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Unlock-iPhone-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode"></a>Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode</h3><p>If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here’s how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the computer and launch the iTunes application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press and hold down the ‘Volume’ and ‘Power’ buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the ‘OK’ button.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, click on the ‘Restore iPhone’ button in the Summary tab.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.</p><h3 id="Use-Siri-only-iOS-version-10"><a href="#Use-Siri-only-iOS-version-10" class="headerlink" title="Use Siri (only iOS version 10)"></a>Use Siri (only iOS version 10)</h3><p>You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without a passcode.

However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock.”</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</p><p>But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-2"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-2" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone Without Passcode.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhones and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge is required.

Wait for a while as it will reset your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max remotely.</p><p>As you can see, the Find my iPhone service was majorly introduced to discover the location of a lost iOS device.

The technique can also be implemented in other iPhone versions like Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, 6 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and more.</p><p>Attention: All your data will be erased while you are unlocking with this tool.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Intuitive instructions to unlock iPhone without the passcode.</li><li>Removes the iPhone’s lock screen whenever it is disabled.</li><li>Works for all models of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.</li><li>Fully compatible with the latest iOS 11.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SG-KuuduzaY"></iframe><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-passcode-without-computer-using-Siri-bug"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-passcode-without-computer-using-Siri-bug" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode without computer using Siri bug?"></a>Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode without computer using Siri bug?</h2><p>This might surprise you, but there is a loophole in Siri that can be exploited to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.

For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won’t take a lot of time at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png"                      alt="checking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup never set in the first place!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png"                      alt="removed"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to “Reset All Settings” on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to avoid the problem of iTunes backup password never set.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-exploring-dynamic-visuals-timelapses-with-ipad-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploring Dynamic Visuals  Timelapses with iPad for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-premiere-streaming-for-performance-artists/"><u>[New] Premiere Streaming for Performance Artists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-tutorial-adding-whimsy-with-snapchat-cartoons/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Tutorial  Adding Whimsy with Snapchat Cartoons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-soothing-20-country-songs-your-guide-to-serene-dancing-on-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Soothing 20 Country Songs  Your Guide to Serene Dancing on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-eco-friendly-visuals-for-film-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Eco-Friendly Visuals for Film Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-precision-screensaver-for-chromebooks/"><u>[Updated] Precision Screensaver for Chromebooks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-tripping-up-heres-how-to-avoid-it/"><u>[Updated] Tripping Up?

Follow the steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with a USB cable.</li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button. If executed, the iTunes connect screen will appear. For earlier iPhone models, you can refer to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/iphone/iph8903c3ee6/15.0"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-11.jpg"                      alt="iphone hard reset"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> iTunes will prompt you to either restore or update your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Choose the <strong>Restore iPhone</strong> option to reset your device to its factory settings. If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max exits recovery mode, you’ll need to repeat the steps.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-4-Using-iCloud-To-Unlock-a-Lock-or-Disabled-iPhone"><a href="#Method-4-Using-iCloud-To-Unlock-a-Lock-or-Disabled-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone"></a>Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone</h3><p>After <strong>many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here’s how.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-12.jpg"                      alt="icloud all devices"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select <strong>All Devices</strong>, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu. Once you’ve chosen the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, click the <strong>Erase iPhone</strong> icon in the lower-right corner. Although the action deletes the data on the phone, you can retrieve it from your iCloud backup once the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is operational again.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-5-Contact-Apple-Support-or-Visit-an-Apple-Store"><a href="#Method-5-Contact-Apple-Support-or-Visit-an-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store"></a>Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store</h3><p>If all methods fail or you don’t have access to Dr.Fone, consider contacting Apple Support. You can also try visiting an Apple Store. Apple experts will guide you through the appropriate steps based on your unique situation.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you are wondering <strong>how many passcode attempts on iPhone</strong> will lock your device and not sure how to fix this issue, here is the way to go. Methods like iTunes, Recovery Mode, iCloud, or seeking Apple Support all offer potential solutions.</p><p>Consider using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) for a secure and data-preserving unlock.

The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.</p><p>However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.</p><p>With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.</p><p>Moreover, you might be able to <strong>use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>.</p><p>Now, you cannot just <strong>unlock any Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with your Watch</strong>. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option.

If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.</p><p>What could work is your Apple Watch.</p><p>Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances.

It’s taking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

To do this, go to iCloud’s website, log in to your Apple account, and select the “Find my iPhone” service. From all the provided lists of the connected devices, remove your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to disable the Find my iPhone service.</p><p>Follow these steps to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without a passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iOS device to the system</strong></p><p>Download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) on your Mac or Windows PC and launch the application. Then go to Toolbox &gt; Screen Unlock &gt; iOS &gt; Unlock iOS Screen to launch the specific tool on a new window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-1.png"                      alt="unlock ios screen"                ></p><p>Using a lightning cable, connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the system.

The key combinations would be different for various iPhone models. The interface also provides quick instructions to do the same. Here’s how you can put your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in Recovery mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="download iPhone firmware"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Provide basic details of your device</strong></p><p>As soon as your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max would enter the Recovery mode, the application will detect it automatically.

Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone’s. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</p><ol><li>Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.</li><li>Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13. Go to the iTunes menu, check for updates, and follow the simple on-screen instructions to update iTunes.</li></ol><p><strong>Step 1. Put your phone in the Recovery Mode</strong></p><p>After meeting the basic prerequisites, you need to put your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in recovery mode by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the system (Mac or Windows) and launch an updated version of iTunes on it.</li><li>Press the Volume Up key quickly. That is, press it only for a second and release it.</li><li>Similarly, quick-press the Volume Down key as well.</li><li>Once the Volume Down key is released, press the Side button.</li><li>Keep pressing the Side key until the connect-to-iTunes symbol would appear on the screen.</li></ol><p>Make sure that all the key combinations should be pressed consecutively. That is, you should not take an evident pause in between.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="put iphone xs in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.

In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try.

If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements.
