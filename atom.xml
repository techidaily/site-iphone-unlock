Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.</p><p>While you can’t remove it, figuring out <strong>how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens</strong> is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device’s battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 8’s lock screen and make it work better for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?"></a>Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?</h2><p>You can’t remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 8 screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 8 device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 8. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 8 lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 8. Even if you’ve applied Part 1’s solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 8: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>. It’s usually located in the bottom left corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 8:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 8’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 8 Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 8 Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 8 flashlight.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 8 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 8 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus-Locked"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus Locked?"></a>Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus Locked?</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 8 Plus from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn’t for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 8 Plus and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.</p><p>We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 8 Plus does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).</p><h3 id="II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus"><a href="#II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-8-Plus" class="headerlink" title="II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 8 Plus"></a>II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 8 Plus</h3><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge is required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Dr.Fone is a set of modules that make life easy for you.

Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 8 Plus.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it.

You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone 7 by implementing the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491422339.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the world clock interface, add another clock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491682149.jpg"                      alt="world clock" title="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The interface will ask you to search for a location of your choice. Type anything on the search tab and select it to get various options.

This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg"                      alt="use find My Apple iPhone 7 to unlock iphone 13 without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the ‘Find My iPhone’ option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select the ‘All Devices’ option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone 7 from the list of devices.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click the ‘Erase’ option to confirm your action.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.</p><h3 id="Unlock-it-with-iTunes"><a href="#Unlock-it-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Unlock it with iTunes"></a>Unlock it with iTunes</h3><p>Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 7 without a passcode is by using iTunes.

This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here’s how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 7:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone 7 to the computer and launch the iTunes application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press and hold down the ‘Volume’ and ‘Power’ buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the ‘OK’ button.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, click on the ‘Restore iPhone’ button in the Summary tab.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed.

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123901/26106" target="_top" id="2123901">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123901" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123901/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle.

There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea.

People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.</p><p>Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 11 Pro world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 11 Pro . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Apple iPhone 11 Pro  without Passcode [No iTunes]</strong></h2><p>The major difference between the lock screen and activation lock is that the lock screen can be bypassed without the password but, the user can never bypass the activation lock as it marks the security boundary of Apple.</p><p>You might be wondering how to escape the lock screen without a password because it is possible that you might forget the password, and now you can’t open your phone. Let’s look at how you can do this;</p><p>The commonly faced problem of many iOS users was that they forget the password but later, an amazing solution to this problem as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> application was known and used by almost all iOS users.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes.

To restart your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.

But have you encountered the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed-out</strong> dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014850/22899" target="_top" id="2014850">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014850" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014850/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.

Affirm Device Model information</strong></p><p>After going to the DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the information about your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. From the following screen, confirm your phone model and iOS version. If it is isn’t correctly given, select the correct data pair from the drop-down menu.

Afterward, click the “Find My” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg"                      alt="select find my feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 7 Plus from “All Devices.” Now choose “Erase iPhone” from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device and remove the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on erase iphone"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Locked-to-Owner"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Locked-to-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Locked to Owner"></a>Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 7 Plus Locked to Owner</h3><p>When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.</p><p>The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone 7 Plus Activation Lock:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 7 Plus Settings to tap “Wi-Fi” and navigate to the “Choose Wi-Fi Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select “More Wi-Fi Settings” using the “i” symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose “Configure DNS” and follow it by selecting the “Manual” option.</p></li><li><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Afterward, press “Add Server,” located under “DNS Servers.” Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:</p></li><li><p>For users in the United States&#x2F;North America: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg"                      alt="use the dns method"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135404/19272" target="_top" id="2135404">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135404" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135404/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Save the changes by selecting “Save.” Use the back arrow button to go back and choose “Ask to Join Networks.” Enter the network password and tap “Join.” Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone 7 Plus attempts to activate.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 7 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Locked"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 7 Plus Locked?"></a>Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 7 Plus Locked?</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 7 Plus from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn’t for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 7 Plus and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.</p><p>We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 7 Plus does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 7 Plus passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).</p><h3 id="II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus"><a href="#II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus" class="headerlink" title="II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 7 Plus"></a>II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 7 Plus</h3><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge is required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Dr.Fone is a set of modules that make life easy for you.

Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 7 Plus  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 7 Plus  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 7 Plus  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features.

This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 11’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up.

While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 11 to the Apple ID used to set it up.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 13 and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 13 device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915865/19272" target="_top" id="1915865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915865/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 13 devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 13 device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults.

And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?</p><p>A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.</p><p>If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.</p><p>But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 13 gets disabled.

In this way, you won’t be able to lose your important files while unlocking your device’s passcode.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now when you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 12 passcode without iTunes, you can easily access your device.
