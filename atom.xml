These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone XS Max screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone XS Max device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone XS Max. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone XS Max lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone XS Max.

For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone XS Max:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight.

Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone XS Max device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone XS Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone XS Max device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone XS Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS Max 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone XS Max"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone XS Max</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS Max 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone XS Max in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.</p><p>Step 5: When done, tap Done.</p><p>In case you are getting the following error:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg"                      alt="face id error"                ></p><p>There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone XS Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone XS Max device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone XS Max (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone XS Max can be used solely with passcodes if you want. If you find that your screen is locked and you can‘t unlock it, you can always find help in tools such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 7’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.</p><p>However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.</p><p>With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 7’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.</p><p>Moreover, you might be able to <strong>use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 7</strong>.</p><p>Now, you cannot just <strong>unlock any Apple iPhone 7 with your Watch</strong>. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option.

While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.</p><p>With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.</p><p>The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.</p><p>What could work is your Apple Watch.</p><p>Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 7 model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances.

It might surprise you, but you can also take the assistance of Siri to unlock your phone. Most users prefer this technique, as it doesn’t require a computer and can unlock an iOS device without erasing its data.</p><p>Though, before you proceed, you need to know the limitations of this method. Since it is considered a loophole in iOS, it doesn’t always yield desirable results. It has been observed that the method only works on devices running from iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. To learn how to unlock iPad passcode without a computer, follow these stepwise instructions:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Activate Siri on your iOS device by holding the Home button. Ask for the present time by giving a command like “Hey Siri, what time is it?” to proceed. Siri will let you know the current time by displaying a clock. Tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463688829.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Tap on the Add (plus) icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463891817.jpg"                      alt="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From here, you can search for a city.

If everything goes right, you will enter the Home screen of your iOS device after unlocking it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994465721934.jpg"                      alt="iphone home" title="iphone home"                ></p><p>By following this technique, you would also learn how to unlock the disabled Apple iPhone 11 4.

Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as “123456” or “password.”</p><ul><li><strong>Length</strong></li></ul><p>Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.</p><p>Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password.

From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.</p><p>Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don’t have to stress the next time you can’t log in to your account.</p><ol><li>Turn on “AutoFill” in “Settings”</li></ol><p>You can turn on <strong>AutoFill</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you’ve entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max will save the information, so you don’t have to enter it again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg"                      alt="autofill"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords</li></ol><p>iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you’ve turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p><ol start="3"><li>Use Notes for passwords</li></ol><p>If you’re finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it “Passwords.” Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.</p><p>You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it’s for.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone’s notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.</p><p>However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can’t even conceive. It’s best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-demystifying-screen-recording-how-bandicam-changes-the-game/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Demystifying Screen Recording How Bandicam Changes the Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-strategic-steps-towards-uncovering-youtubes-secret-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Strategic Steps Towards Uncovering YouTube's Secret Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/detailed-review-of-doctorsim-unlock-service-for-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Detailed Review of doctorSIM Unlock Service For Apple iPhone 11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/detecting-intruder-in-your-digital-life/"><u>Detecting Intruder in Your Digital Life</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-12-pro-apples-new-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro, Apples New iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-15-plus-passcode-without-itunes-without-knowing-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock iPhone 15 Plus Passcode without iTunes without Knowing Passcode? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-your-iphone-15-pro-max-in-security-lockout-proper-ways-to-unlock-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Is Your iPhone 15 Pro Max in Security Lockout?

It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only.

Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.</p><p>In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 11 Pro based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 11 Pro from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems.

If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data.

So you will have to click on the other option named <strong>Restore iPhone</strong>.</li><li>By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro XR lock screen without any passcode.</li></ol><h3 id="Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone"></a>Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone</h3><p>If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven’t used iTunes before, we have another solution.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Reasons for Creating a New Apple ID Account"></a>A. Reasons for Creating a New Apple ID Account</h3><p>Here’s a breakdown of the reasons why you should <strong>create a new Apple ID for your Apple iPhone XS</strong>:</p><ul><li>Your Apple ID is like your digital identity. Creating a new one lets you choose a unique email address that suits you, adding a personal touch to your Apple journey.</li><li>Maybe you’ve been using an email for your Apple ID that you don’t want to use anymore. Creating a new one helps keep your personal and Apple-related emails separate.</li><li>**Switching Devices.**When you switch to a new Apple device, like getting a new iPhone or iPad, creating a unique Apple ID ensures a fresh start tailored to your new gadget.</li><li>**Separation of Accounts.**Sometimes, you may want to keep your work-related apps and data separate from your ones. Creating a new Apple ID helps you achieve this separation.</li><li>If you’re using Apple services for different purposes, such as work and personal use, having separate Apple IDs can help keep everything organized and distinct.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/create-new-apple-id-account-02.jpg"                      alt="create a free apple id account"                ></p><h3 id="B-Scenarios-Where-a-New-ID-Is-Needed"><a href="#B-Scenarios-Where-a-New-ID-Is-Needed" class="headerlink" title="B. Scenarios Where a New ID Is Needed"></a>B. Scenarios Where a New ID Is Needed</h3><p>Below are the common scenarios where a new Apple ID might be needed:</p><ul><li>**New Apple Device.**When you purchase a new Apple device, like an iPhone or iPad, you’ll need a new Apple ID to set it up and make it truly yours.</li><li>**Shared Device.**If multiple people use the same device, creating a new Apple ID for each user ensures that everyone has their own personalized experience.</li><li>**Change of Email.**If your current email address associated with your Apple ID is changed or you prefer a new one, creating a unique Apple ID with the updated email is the solution.</li><li>**Work and Personal.**To keep your work-related apps and data separate from your personal ones, having separate Apple IDs for each purpose is practical and organized.</li><li>**Starting Fresh.**Sometimes, you might want a fresh start with your Apple experience, and creating a new Apple ID provides a clean slate.</li></ul><p><strong>Creating a new Apple ID</strong> isn’t just about getting a new email; it’s about tailoring your Apple experience to your needs, whether for personalization, privacy, or organization. Now that you know why it’s essential, let’s explore how to create it in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-How-To-Create-a-New-Apple-ID-Account"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-How-To-Create-a-New-Apple-ID-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step-by-Step Guide: How To Create a New Apple ID Account"></a>Part 2: Step-by-Step Guide: How To Create a New Apple ID Account</h2><p><strong>Creating a new Apple ID for free</strong> is a straightforward process.

Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone XS device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone XS (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone XS can be used solely with passcodes if you want. If you find that your screen is locked and you can‘t unlock it, you can always find help in tools such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS). So go ahead, use the new Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS with confidence, and enjoy a more secure experience on your new iPhone than ever before.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone 13&#x2F; iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="iPhone-Is-Disabled-Here-Is-The-Way-To-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-XS"><a href="#iPhone-Is-Disabled-Here-Is-The-Way-To-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-XS" class="headerlink" title="iPhone Is Disabled?

This was an aftermarket app to help you through the process.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone XS and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone XS device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone XS devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone XS device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.</p><h2 id="Part-III-FAQs"><a href="#Part-III-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part III: FAQs"></a>Part III: FAQs</h2><p>Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled"><a href="#FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?"></a>FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?</h3><p>iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss"><a href="#FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?"></a>FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?</h3><p>Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone XS device.

Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone’s information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device has an activation lock enabled.</p><p>The DNS bypass will send a fake “device isn’t locked” message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 7 Plus and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>:</p><ul><li>Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.</li><li>A WiFi screen will spring up.

There are a few things you can do:</p><p>Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.</p><p>So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode.

Use Find My iPhone in iCloud</h3><p>Apple allows clients to erase iPhone data to safeguard it from others remotely. However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don’t erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 12 mini will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.</p><p>If you have enabled the “Find My” option before <strong>forgotten iPhone PIN</strong>, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.</p><p>To unlock iPhone through iCloud:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the “Find iPhone” option from the different choices available.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Click “All Devices” and pick the Apple iPhone 12 mini device you need to unlock.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “Erase iPhone” button. Subsequently, set up the Apple iPhone 12 mini device and set another lock screen PIN.

However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.</p><p>Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup.

It will warn about an issue with the “Your iPhone name” and ask you to restore it. In that window, select “Restore” to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn’t run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up iPhone.</strong></p><p>Keep waiting until the restoration completes.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.</p><p>Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone. Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value.

In this case, we strongly suggest you use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is a reliable tool and has been in the market for a long time. Professional unlock service providers use it because of its ease of use and clean interface.</p><p>So, without looking any further, download this tool for a remarkable unlocking experience. The methods below will guide you into unlocking your Apple iPhone XR within no time:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone XR&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone software and tap the “Unlock iOS Screen.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery&#x2F;DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before bypassing the Apple iPhone XR lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen guidelines. The Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. However, if you can’t activate the Recovery mode, you can figure out how to activate the DFU mode from their official site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Affirm Device Information</strong></p><p>After getting the phone in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone XR device information, for example, the Apple iPhone XR model and other data. You can choose the right information from the dropdown menu if the information isn’t right. Then, at that point, download the firmware for your Apple iPhone XR.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="device information"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.
