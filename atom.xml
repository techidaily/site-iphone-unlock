Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Connect your locked iPhone using a cable and let iTunes identify the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Next, navigate to the <strong>Summary</strong> section and select the <strong>Restore iPhone</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-10.jpg"                      alt="itunes main window"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Allow iTunes to identify your device.

What To Do When iCloud Activation Lock Active?"></a>Part 5. What To Do When iCloud Activation Lock Active?</h2><p>Although IMEI Unlocking turns out to be quite an exceptional service, it generally is not the only thing that becomes a barrier for iPhone users. The iCloud Activation binds an Apple device to a user’s Apple ID, making itself a great security measure. It presents a unique circumstance where services such as <strong>doctorSIM legit</strong> are inapplicable. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> specializes in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock.</p><p>It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions. Once the activation lock is removed, it grants full access to users’ devices. Dr.Fone also extends its capabilities to remove an Apple ID in cases where the password is forgotten. Its remarkable performance includes the permanent bypass of the Apple ID lock.</p><h3 id="Notable-Characteristics-of-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Notable-Characteristics-of-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Notable Characteristics of Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Notable Characteristics of Wondershare Dr.Fone</h3><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html" >Remove MDM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Screen Time passcodes on your device effortlessly, preserving your data.</li><li>Wondershare Dr.Fone specializes in bypassing various screen locks, including passcodes and Face IDs.</li><li>Fone can remove the iTunes backup encryption lock without any impact on your data.</li></ol><h3 id="Steps-To-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-via-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Steps-To-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-via-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock via Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Steps To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock via Wondershare Dr.Fone</h3><p>Dr.Fone is intended for users locked out of their devices. Given below are the steps you need to follow when using Dr.Fone to bypass iCloud Activation Lock:</p><h4 id="1-For-Devices-Running-iOS-iPadOS-12-0-to-14-8-1"><a href="#1-For-Devices-Running-iOS-iPadOS-12-0-to-14-8-1" class="headerlink" title="1. For Devices Running iOS&#x2F;iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1"></a>1. For Devices Running iOS&#x2F;iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1</h4><ul><li><strong>Step 1. Installation and iCloud Activation Lock Removal</strong></li></ul><p>Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the “Toolbox” tab, navigate to “Screen Unlock” and select “iOS.” In the following window, choose “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” and click “Start” to begin the process and receive a prompt to connect your iOS device. Once connected, the window will display the progress status.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="proceed with icloud activation lock removal"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2. Device Identification and Unlock Initiation</strong></li></ul><p>Now, decide whether your device is GSM or CDMA, as it is an important aspect. Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device won’t affect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. However, running this process on a CDMA device will result in a loss of cellular activities. Click “Unlock Now” to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you’ll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click “Got It!” after agreeing with all the mentioned points.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-4.png"                      alt="start to unlock device"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.

Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes.

Here’s What to Do"></a>Forgot Apple iPhone 15 Pro Backup Password? Here’s What to Do</h2><p>Forgetting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can’t access your data, but it also means you can’t restore your phone if something goes wrong.</p><p>There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 15 Pro backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you’re having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 15 Pro backup password, don’t despair. There are still ways to get it back!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg"                      alt="forget backup password"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 15 Pro is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1.

Now, lock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro screen and then wake the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device without looking at it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-11.jpg"                      alt="set switch control as accessibility shortcut"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, we have explored different ways to <strong>unlock iPhones without swiping up</strong> beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We’ve talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.</p><p>While these methods are helpful, there’s a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that’s particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can’t get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called “Screen Unlock” that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-accelerating-the-playback-of-instagram-videos-tips/"><u>[New] Accelerating the Playback of Instagram Videos (Tips)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-expert-advice-on-youtube-short-pitfalls/"><u>[New] Expert Advice on YouTube Short Pitfalls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-newcomers-pathway-maximizing-money-on-periscope-platform/"><u>[New] In 2024, Newcomer's Pathway  Maximizing Money on Periscope Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-10-google-cardboards-most-stunning-vr-games/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 10  Google Cardboard's Most Stunning VR Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-perfecting-the-art-of-mi-11-screen-recording-for-2024/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step  Perfecting the Art of Mi 11 Screen Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-top-30-camcorders-front-screen-first-thought/"><u>[New] Top 30 Camcorders - Front Screen First Thought</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-film-your-facebook-video/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Film Your FACEbook Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unveiling-the-art-of-podcast-storytelling-expert-tips-plus-10plus-sample-scripts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unveiling the Art of Podcast Storytelling  Expert Tips + 10+ Sample Scripts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-screenshot-supreme-in-depth-recorder-reviews/"><u>[Updated] Screenshot Supreme  In-Depth Recorder Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-selection-economical-hd-action-recordings/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Selection  Economical HD Action Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/5-most-effective-methods-to-unlock-iphone-se-2022-in-lost-mode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock iPhone SE (2022) in Lost Mode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/7-top-ways-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-for-iphone-xs-max-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>7 Top Ways To Resolve Apple ID Not Active Issue For iPhone XS Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-iphone-6-plus-blacklist-removal-tips-and-tools-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to iPhone 6 Plus Blacklist Removal Tips and Tools | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-7-plus-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple iPhone 7 Plus Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

Dr.Fone is a suite of apps designed to help you with tasks on your smartphones and tablets.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer.

There are a few things you can do:</p><p>Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.</p><p>So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.</p><p>You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.</p><p>So, if you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 15 Pro passcode and are looking for how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro without passcode, use this guide to pick one of the three easy ways to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro in case of forgotten passcode.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-from-zero-to-live-streaming-hero-essential-tips-and-tricks/"><u>[New] From Zero to Live-Streaming Hero  Essential Tips and Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-jumpstart-your-tiktok-presence-top-30-engaging-username-ideas/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Jumpstart Your TikTok Presence - Top 30 Engaging Username Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-gif-galore-converting-tweet-videos-at-zero-cost-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] GIF Galore  Converting Tweet Videos at Zero Cost for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-art-of-storytelling-integrating-captions-into-your-instagram-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Art of Storytelling  Integrating Captions Into Your Instagram Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comprehensive-review-and-overview-of-du-recorder/"><u>2024 Approved  Comprehensive Review and Overview of Du Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-infusing-life-into-ppt-with-professional-voiceovers/"><u>2024 Approved  Infusing Life Into PPT with Professional Voiceovers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-unlock-iphone-6s-without-passcode-or-face-id-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6s without Passcode or Face ID | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/5-most-effective-methods-to-unlock-apple-iphone-6-in-lost-mode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 in Lost Mode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/5-most-effective-methods-to-unlock-apple-iphone-xs-in-lost-mode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone XS in Lost Mode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/7-ways-to-lock-apps-on-iphone-xr-and-ipad-securely-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>7 Ways to Lock Apps on iPhone XR and iPad Securely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/capturing-real-life-the-art-of-writing-docs-for-2024/"><u>Capturing Real Life  The Art of Writing Docs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/disabling-iphone-14-pro-parental-restrictions-withwithout-password-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Disabling iPhone 14 Pro Parental Restrictions With/Without Password | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-unlock-iphone-14-plus-with-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Full Guide to Unlock iPhone 14 Plus with iTunes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-the-required-apple-store-verification-for-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For iPhone 6 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-apple-id-password-on-your-iphone-12-pro-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Change Your Apple ID Password On your iPhone 12 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-iphone-7-plus-unavailable-issue-with-ease-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Fix iPhone 7 Plus Unavailable Issue With Ease | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-passcode-from-apple-iphone-7-plus-complete-guide-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Remove Passcode From Apple iPhone 7 Plus?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Best-Methods-to-Unlock-the-‘iPhone-Locked-to-Owner’-for-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#The-Best-Methods-to-Unlock-the-‘iPhone-Locked-to-Owner’-for-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="The Best Methods to Unlock the ‘iPhone Locked to Owner’ for Apple iPhone 15 Pro"></a>The Best Methods to Unlock the ‘iPhone Locked to Owner’ for Apple iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p>Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the “iPhone Locked to Owner” scenario can be hard as the fault doesn’t lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device will remain locked to the previous owner’s iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Locked-to-Owner-Security"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Locked-to-Owner-Security" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Locked to Owner Security"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Locked to Owner Security</h2><p>Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner’s security can be frustrating. That’s why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to <strong><strong>bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro locked to the owner for free</strong></strong>. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-device"><a href="#Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device"></a>Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device</h3><p>If you’ve recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.</p><p>To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step:</strong></strong> Access your locked iPhone and tap “Unlock with Passcode.” On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg"                      alt="tap unlock with passcode"                ></p></li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-device-Using-iCloud"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-device-Using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device Using iCloud"></a>Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device Using iCloud</h3><p>The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn’t remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.</p><p>To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Access the iCloud website on your computer’s browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the “Find My” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg"                      alt="select find my feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro from “All Devices.” Now choose “Erase iPhone” from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and remove the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on erase iphone"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Locked-to-Owner"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Locked-to-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Locked to Owner"></a>Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Locked to Owner</h3><p>When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.</p><p>The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Activation Lock:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Settings to tap “Wi-Fi” and navigate to the “Choose Wi-Fi Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select “More Wi-Fi Settings” using the “i” symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose “Configure DNS” and follow it by selecting the “Manual” option.</p></li><li><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Afterward, press “Add Server,” located under “DNS Servers.” Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:</p></li><li><p>For users in the United States&#x2F;North America: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg"                      alt="use the dns method"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Save the changes by selecting “Save.” Use the back arrow button to go back and choose “Ask to Join Networks.” Enter the network password and tap “Join.” Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone 15 Pro attempts to activate. Afterward, continue to set up your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-4-Take-Help-From-the-Online-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Removal-Service"><a href="#Method-4-Take-Help-From-the-Online-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Removal-Service" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service"></a>Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service</h3><p>What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn’t working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. All you need to provide them is your Apple iPhone 15 Pro IMEI number. The process is done remotely and takes 24 to 48 hours to complete.</p><p>Ensure your device IMEI is not blacklisted before sending it for the unlocking process. Described below are steps to use <a href="https://directunlocks.com/en_us/icloud-unlock"><u>DirectUnlocks</u></a>, an iCloud Activation removal service:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Use your computer’s browser to visit the official DriectUnlocks website.

This guide will cover every one of the techniques that you can use for <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-Happen-When-iPhone-Is-in-Lost-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-Happen-When-iPhone-Is-in-Lost-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?"></a>Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 15 Pro Lock feature permits remotely locking a lost Apple iPhone 15 Pro to prevent people from using its data. If you set a password for a device before enabling the Lost Mode, you will need this password to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro once it has returned to its proprietor.</p><p>The Lost Mode menu will ask you to set one if it has no password. Password is obligatory to stop Lost Mode once a device is returned to the owner, as Contact ID or Face ID won’t work for this reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-1.jpg"                      alt="lost mode"                ></p><p><strong>Send a Custom Text Message:</strong> When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.</p><p><strong>Erase Data Remotely:</strong> Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 15 Pro if you believe it’s been some time since it’s gone and you don’t think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.</p><p><strong>Track Your Device on Map:</strong> An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p><strong>Play Songs:</strong> Playing a sound might assist you with finding your lost iPhone if it’s still close by. The Apple iPhone 15 Pro will play a sound at top volume, no matter what volume level was set on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device when you lost it.</p><h3 id="1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode"><a href="#1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode" class="headerlink" title="1.

Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode</h3><p>The most straightforward method for unlocking the Apple iPhone 15 Pro in Lost Mode is entering the password on the actual device. If your device was protected with a password before placing it in Lost Mode, enter it again.</p><p>If your device had no password while placing it in Lost Mode and you’ve entered it into iCloud while placing your Apple iPhone 15 Pro into Lost Mode, utilize this password. That will help you <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>, and you can start operating your Apple iPhone 15 Pro again.</p><h3 id="2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove it from Find My in iCloud"></a>2. Remove it from Find My in iCloud</h3><p>One more method for unlocking the Lost Mode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is to utilize the Find My iPhone application on the official iCloud site. Follow the steps underneath to do so:</p><ol><li>Go to &lt;<a href="http://www.icloud.com>">www.icloud.com&gt;</a> and utilize your account details to sign in.</li><li>Click the “Find My iPhone” button and select all iDevices.</li><li>Pick the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you need to unlock in Lost Mode and tap the “Lost Mode” button.</li><li>Click the “Stop Lost Mode” button to remove the lock from the phone.</li><li>Confirm this activity by clicking the “Stop Lost Mode” button again.</li></ol><h3 id="3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone’s information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device has an activation lock enabled.</p><p>The DNS bypass will send a fake “device isn’t locked” message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>:</p><ul><li>Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.</li><li>A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the “I” icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap “Forget this Network.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on “Configure DNS,” and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:</li></ul><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p><p>Asia: 104.155.28.90</p><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p><ul><li>Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network. Click the Back button when a popup says that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device is attempting to connect to the Apple servers.</li><li>You will now be on the DNS bypass screen.

However, only a handful of applications are available through this.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Use-Emergency-Call"><a href="#4-Use-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Emergency Call"></a>4. Use Emergency Call</h3><p>This technique is the most widely recognized one. You can bypass your iCloud activation by settling on a fake Emergency call. Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won’t work for everyone.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:</strong></p><ul><li>Click the “Emergency Call” option on your locked device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg"                      alt="emergency call"                ></p><ul><li>Dial “*#96274825*0000*1#,” then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.</li><li>If it’s not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn’t work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.</li><li>Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again. Now create a new password after <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Asking-for-Passcode-after-iOS-17-14-Update-What-to-Do"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Asking-for-Passcode-after-iOS-17-14-Update-What-to-Do" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 15 Pro Asking for Passcode after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update, What to Do?"></a>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Asking for Passcode after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update, What to Do?</h2><p>If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17&#x2F;14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 15 Pro displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.</p><p>This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 15 Pro in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try.

If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security.

How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?</h2><p>iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple’s security doesn’t allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is restricted and doesn’t support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is locked or not:</p><h3 id="Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings"><a href="#Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings"></a>Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings</h3><p>To check whether your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, open your Apple iPhone 15 Pro “Settings” and tap the “General” option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="check carrier lock from settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After that, choose the “Carrier Lock” option to see the restrictions. If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is unlocked, it will not show any SIM restriction. If you see the “SIM Locked” restriction, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is locked.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="iphone is carrier locked"                ></p><h3 id="Check-iPhone-Got-Disabled-Issue"><a href="#Check-iPhone-Got-Disabled-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue"></a>Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue</h3><p>The “iPhone is Disabled” issue appears when you or anyone else enters the wrong passcode multiple times. In that case, Apple’s security restricts you from entering the passcode for a specific time interval. After a while, it might permanently disable your Apple iPhone 15 Pro from being accessed through a passcode or any other direct security unlocking option. However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="iphone is disabled issue"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-It-Cost-To-Unlock-iPhone-Carrier-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-It-Cost-To-Unlock-iPhone-Carrier-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 15 Pro screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.

Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 Pro with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either.

At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).</p><h3 id="II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro"></a>II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro</h3><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge is required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Dr.Fone is a set of modules that make life easy for you.

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 15 Pro, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.</p><h3 id="II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="II.III Put The Apple iPhone 15 Pro in Recovery Mode"></a>II.III Put The Apple iPhone 15 Pro in Recovery Mode</h3><p>You can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro using Recovery Mode, yourself.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.</p><p>Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="press volume botton"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 15 Pro"></a>Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p>If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you’re coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><p>Step 1: Launch Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 3: Enter your passcode.</p><p>Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="turn passcode off"                ></p><p>Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.</p><p>You’re done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 15 Pro itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-More-information-about-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-mini-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Pro"><a href="#Part-IV-More-information-about-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-mini-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 15 Pro&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro mini&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro Pro"></a>Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 15 Pro&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro mini&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro Pro</h2><p>The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro now.

You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don’t sit up.</p><p><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></p><p>You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 15 Pro models support Cinematic Mode.</p><p><strong>Water Resistance and Charging</strong></p><p>All Apple iPhone 15 Pro models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 15 Pro 12 mini was.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>A locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro is never a pretty sight.

Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro without a passcode.</p><p>There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone’s stock features like Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro lock screen.</p><p>So, let’s get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro lock screen.</p><h2 id="4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-without-Passcode"><a href="#4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro without Passcode"></a>4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro without Passcode</h2><p>Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro without a passcode:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes"><a href="#Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes"></a>Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 15 Pro passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="using itunes to unlock iphone"                ></p><p>Follow the steps to do this.</p><ol><li>First, connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to your computer and launch iTunes.

For installation, <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes" >click here and download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.</li><li>Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named <strong>Restore iPhone</strong>.</li><li>By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro XR lock screen without any passcode.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone"></a>Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone</h3><p>If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven’t used iTunes before, we have another solution.

Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it.

These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 15 Pro screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Even if you’ve applied Part 1’s solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>. It’s usually located in the bottom left corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 15 Pro flashlight.

Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.</p><p>While you can’t remove it, figuring out <strong>how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens</strong> is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device’s battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s lock screen and make it work better for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?"></a>Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?</h2><p>You can’t remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 15 Pro screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Even if you’ve applied Part 1’s solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>. It’s usually located in the bottom left corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 15 Pro flashlight.

To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:</p><h3 id="1-Check-Device-Eligibility"><a href="#1-Check-Device-Eligibility" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Device Eligibility"></a>1. Check Device Eligibility</h3><p>Make sure your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.</p><h3 id="2-Backup-Your-Data"><a href="#2-Backup-Your-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Backup Your Data"></a>2. Backup Your Data</h3><p>Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.</p><p>If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.</p><h3 id="3-Understand-Terms-and-Conditions"><a href="#3-Understand-Terms-and-Conditions" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand Terms and Conditions"></a>3. Understand Terms and Conditions</h3><p>Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud’s Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s data.</p><p>Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.</p><h3 id="4-Follow-Instructions-Carefully"><a href="#4-Follow-Instructions-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="4. Follow Instructions Carefully"></a>4. Follow Instructions Carefully</h3><p>Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.</p><p>Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.</p><h3 id="5-Troubleshooting-Common-Issues"><a href="#5-Troubleshooting-Common-Issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Troubleshooting Common Issues"></a>5. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn’t been unlocked during this time.</p><p>When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to the computer.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro can be daunting when you’ve forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues. Thankfully, there are different methods available to regain access to your device. This article explored three methods: using iCloud’s Find My iPhone, restoring with iTunes, and utilizing Dr.Fone.

It’s like a digital timeout and can be a real headache. Imagine not being able to use your Apple iPhone 15 Pro fully because it’s on a blacklist. That means no calls, texts, or internet – not exactly the Apple iPhone 15 Pro experience you signed up for, right?</p><p>But don’t fret! This article is here to demystify the Apple iPhone 15 Pro blacklist and show you how to fix it. It will take you on a journey of <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong>. By the end, you’ll be able to bring your Apple iPhone 15 Pro back to life.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-01.jpg"                      alt="blacklisted iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Decoding-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Blacklist-What-You-Need-To"><a href="#Part-1-Decoding-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Blacklist-What-You-Need-To" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Decoding the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Blacklist: What You Need To"></a>Part 1. Decoding the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Blacklist: What You Need To</h2><p>You might have heard the term “blacklisted iPhone” before, but what does it mean? Well, it’s like your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is in a timeout and can’t play with the other phones. Let’s break it down in simple terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklisted"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone"><a href="#What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?"></a>What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?</h3><p>When an iPhone is blacklisted, it’s been labeled as “not-so-friendly” in the digital world. It’s like when you’re not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.</p><h3 id="Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted"><a href="#Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?"></a>Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?</h3><p>There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:</p><ul><li>**Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That’s because protecting the original owner’s data and privacy is essential.</li><li>**Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn’t pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.</li></ul><h3 id="What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Is-Blacklisted"><a href="#What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Is-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Is Blacklisted?"></a>What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Is Blacklisted?</h3><p>Now, here’s where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is blacklisted, it won’t work like it should. Here’s what you might experience:</p><ul><li>**No Calls or Texts.**You won’t be able to make or receive calls and texts. It’s like your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is suddenly mute.</li><li>**No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro will be like a disconnected island.</li><li>**Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, its value will drop if it’s blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.</li></ul><p>So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don’t have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 15 Pro back in action with some easy-to-follow <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> steps.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free"></a>Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free</h2><p>Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 15 Pro to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let’s talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 15 Pro free. The good news is there’s a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklist removal"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal"><a href="#What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal" class="headerlink" title="What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?"></a>What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?</h3><p>Going through a <strong>blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro</strong> is like giving your device a second chance. It’s taking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place. Prevention is always better than a cure, right? Here are some easy steps to make sure your Apple iPhone 15 Pro stays in the clear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-04.jpg"                      alt="how to avoid iphone blacklist"                ></p><h3 id="Check-the-iPhone’s-History-Before-Buying"><a href="#Check-the-iPhone’s-History-Before-Buying" class="headerlink" title="Check the iPhone’s History Before Buying"></a>Check the iPhone’s History Before Buying</h3><p>Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone’s background. Make sure it’s not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone’s IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.</p><h3 id="Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Secure"><a href="#Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Secure" class="headerlink" title="Keep Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Secure"></a>Keep Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Secure</h3><p>Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.</p><h3 id="Pay-Your-Bills-on-Time"><a href="#Pay-Your-Bills-on-Time" class="headerlink" title="Pay Your Bills on Time"></a>Pay Your Bills on Time</h3><p>Your iPhone needs its “phone allowance” paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro getting blacklisted.</p><h3 id="Be-Careful-With-iCloud"><a href="#Be-Careful-With-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Be Careful With iCloud"></a>Be Careful With iCloud</h3><p>iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s data. Don’t share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s status.</p><h3 id="Report-a-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Report-a-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone"></a>Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone</h3><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.</p><h3 id="Beware-of-Scams"><a href="#Beware-of-Scams" class="headerlink" title="Beware of Scams"></a>Beware of Scams</h3><p>Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid buying iPhones from unreliable sources or individuals you don’t trust.</p><p>By following these simple preventive measures, you can keep your device clear and avoid the hassle of dealing with the whole <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> process.

This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.</p><p>The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.</p><p>What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html"><u>Touch ID</u></a> if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg"                      alt="verification required notification"                ></p><h3 id="Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear"><a href="#Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear"></a>Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear</h3><p>There are several reasons why you might see an <strong>Apple Store’ Verification</strong> <strong>Required</strong>’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:</p><ul><li><strong>New Apple ID</strong>. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.</li><li><strong>Unpaid balance</strong>. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.</li></ul><p>Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID</h2><p>Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game.

Here’s how to tackle it:</p><h3 id="Update-Payment-Method"><a href="#Update-Payment-Method" class="headerlink" title="Update Payment Method"></a>Update Payment Method</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the <strong>Settings app</strong>, then go to <strong>Payment &amp; Shipping</strong>. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.</p><h3 id="Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions"><a href="#Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions" class="headerlink" title="Check Unpaid Subscriptions"></a>Check Unpaid Subscriptions</h3><p>Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store &gt; your profile icon, and select <strong>Subscriptions</strong>. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder.
