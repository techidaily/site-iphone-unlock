It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work.

Nonetheless, even the most cutting-edge devices experience occasional setbacks. Among these, one major problem for iPhone users is the “iPhone Unavailable” message. This problem typically arises when many incorrect passcode attempts have locked the Apple iPhone 6s device. It renders the Apple iPhone 6s device inaccessible, displaying the “iPhone Unavailable” prompt.</p><p>Yet, worry not, for reliable methods exist to address this problem efficiently. In this guide, we’ll explore the best and proven techniques for <strong>how to fix iPhone unavailable</strong>. We will also walk you through step-by-step solutions and provide clear instructions to resolve your unavailable iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-fix-iphone-unavailable-issue-1.jpg"                      alt="fix iphone unavailable"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-iPhone-is-Unavailable-Explaining-the-Basics"><a href="#Part-1-iPhone-is-Unavailable-Explaining-the-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. iPhone is Unavailable: Explaining the Basics"></a>Part 1. iPhone is Unavailable: Explaining the Basics</h2><p>The “iPhone Unavailable” issue is a distressing fix encountered by users. It occurs when their <strong>iPhone becomes unavailable with a black screen</strong> and inaccessible due to many incorrect passcode attempts. This problem arises as a security measure implemented by Apple. Its primary aim is to protect the data on the Apple iPhone 6s device and deter unauthorized access.</p><p>The iPhone’s security mechanism typically activates after six wrong attempts. It starts with making the Apple iPhone 6s unavailable for a specific period. The device becomes permanently locked when the incorrect code is entered consecutively for the 10th time. This lock manifests as the “iPhone Unavailable” message on the screen.</p><p>This acts as a shield against potential intruders trying to gain access by guessing or brute-forcing the passcode. However, this protective measure can affect users who forget their passcodes or insert incorrect entries mistakenly. For example, there are cases of children playing with the Apple iPhone 6s device, leading to accidental key presses.

Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

Make sure it’s not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone’s IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.</p><h3 id="Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-6s-Secure"><a href="#Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-6s-Secure" class="headerlink" title="Keep Your Apple iPhone 6s Secure"></a>Keep Your Apple iPhone 6s Secure</h3><p>Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 6s.

If the automatic detection is incorrect, set it correctly before proceeding. Click Start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="automatic detection of device and software drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> When Dr.Fone is ready to unlock disabled iPhone, click Unlock Now and wait until the notification of a successful unlock is shown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with drfone screen unlock"                ></p><h3 id="II-II-Unlock-Disabled-iPhone-With-iTunes-macOS-Finder"><a href="#II-II-Unlock-Disabled-iPhone-With-iTunes-macOS-Finder" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Unlock Disabled iPhone With iTunes&#x2F; macOS Finder"></a>II.II: Unlock Disabled iPhone With iTunes&#x2F; macOS Finder</h3><p>The above was a fast, intuitive, step-by-step way to get you through the unlock disabled iPhone process. This was an aftermarket app to help you through the process. However, if you want to achieve the same result the Apple way, do the following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the computer with the cable and launch iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina and above).</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the volume up key on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and release. Then, press the volume down key and release. Lastly, press and hold the power key till you see Recovery Mode in Finder or iTunes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="iphone recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click Restore to unlock disabled iPhone.</p><p>After this process, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro is reset to factory defaults, and you will need to go through the setup process again.</p><h3 id="II-III-Unlock-Disabled-iPhone-Through-The-iCloud-Website-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#II-III-Unlock-Disabled-iPhone-Through-The-iCloud-Website-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Unlock Disabled iPhone Through The iCloud Website (Find My iPhone)"></a>II.III: Unlock Disabled iPhone Through The iCloud Website (Find My iPhone)</h3><p>You may also use Find My on the iCloud website to unlock your disabled iPhone, if the Find My network was enabled on the iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log in using the iCloud&#x2F; Apple ID that the disabled iPhone is using. This is important because if you use any other ID, you will see devices attached to that ID, not the disabled iPhone you want to unlock.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click Find My and select your disabled iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>The Apple iPhone 12 Pro will be erased and restored to factory default settings.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.</p><h2 id="Part-III-FAQs"><a href="#Part-III-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part III: FAQs"></a>Part III: FAQs</h2><p>Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled"><a href="#FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?"></a>FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?</h3><p>iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.</p><h3 id="FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss"><a href="#FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?"></a>FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?</h3><p>Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device.

And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?</p><p>A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.</p><p>If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.</p><p>But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone?

If the model displayed is incorrect, use the dropdown to pick the correct detail.

Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. When you set the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device up again, if you set it to use iCloud, data such as Contacts, iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive data, etc. will be downloaded onto your device again. The apps you had on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder"><a href="#Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Using iTunes or macOS Finder"></a>Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Using iTunes or macOS Finder</h2><p>Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to a Windows&#x2F; macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn’t require going through complex hoops.</p><p>Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 1: Visit <em><a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> and log in into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my iphone"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max remotely and your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max once again.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App"><a href="#Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App"></a>Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App</h2><p>There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. This method is particularly useful if you’re traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="find my on macos"                ></p><p>Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max devices from the left pane, click&#x2F; tap your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and click&#x2F; tap Erase This Device</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Without-A-Computer"><a href="#Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Without-A-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Without A Computer"></a>Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Without A Computer</h2><p>There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and return the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Forgot-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Backup-Password-Here’s-What-to-Do"><a href="#Forgot-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Backup-Password-Here’s-What-to-Do" class="headerlink" title="Forgot Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Backup Password? Here’s What to Do"></a>Forgot Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Backup Password? Here’s What to Do</h2><p>Forgetting your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can’t access your data, but it also means you can’t restore your phone if something goes wrong.</p><p>There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you’re having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max backup password, don’t despair. There are still ways to get it back!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg"                      alt="forget backup password"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="1.

Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-X-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-X-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from being unlocked by thieves"></a>Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from being unlocked by thieves</h2><p>It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.</p><p>The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.</p><p>What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html"><u>Touch ID</u></a> if your device supports these features.

If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.</li><li><strong>Unpaid balance</strong>. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.</li></ul><p>Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message.

No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 11 Pro world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 11 Pro . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

After when your Apple iPhone 7 would be restored, you can access it without any lock. It can be done by following these steps:</p><p>1. Firstly, you need to put your device in recovery mode. Beforehand, you need to make sure that your device is turned off. If not, press the Power button and slide the screen to turn your Apple iPhone 7 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060132012488.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock Apple iPhone 7 passcode without itunes-put Apple iPhone 7 in recovery mode"                ></p><p>2.

This is because, as of now, there is no way to unlock an iPhone without restoring it. Needless to say, while restoring a device, its data is automatically lost. Since Apple is quite concerned about the security of the Apple iPhone 7 and the sensitivity of its data, it doesn’t let users unlock the Apple iPhone 7 device without losing their data.</p><p>Even though lots of users have complained about this issue, Apple hasn’t come up with a solution yet. The best way to avoid this scenario is by taking a regular backup of your data. You can either backup your data on iCloud, via iTunes, or by using any third-party tool as well. In this way, you won’t be able to lose your important files while unlocking your device’s passcode.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now when you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 7 passcode without iTunes, you can easily access your device.

Moreover, you can eliminate the Apple iPhone X device’s screen lock to unlock it.</p><p>To erase the passcode using the Find My feature on iCloud:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to iCloud.com and enter your Apple account credentials and log in to your account.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pick “Find iPhone” and go to “All Devices” &gt; “Erase iPhone”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="find my"                ></p><h3 id="2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes"></a>2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes</h3><p>How to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone X in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone X device.</p><p>It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.</p><p>Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won’t be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen’s passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn’t so hard. Here’s how to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode with iTunes:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone X, iPad, or iPod Contact.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>On iPhone 8&#x2F;8 Or later:</strong> Hold the Power&#x2F;Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone X to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone X transforms into the recovery mode screen.</li><li><strong>On iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Or Below:</strong> Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone X to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone X.</strong></p><p>After connecting your Apple iPhone X to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, “There is an issue with the ‘iPhone name’ that needs it to be restored.” In that window, select “Restore” to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn’t run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up iPhone.</strong></p><p>Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone X and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="itunes unlock"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option"><a href="#3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option" class="headerlink" title="3. “Erase iPhone” Option"></a>3. “Erase iPhone” Option</h3><p>However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone X device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><p>After several wrong attempts, an “Erase iPhone” choice will appear on the screen’s lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone X and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.</p><p>If the Apple iPhone X device can’t connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone X cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Siri"><a href="#4-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Siri"></a>4. Use Siri</h3><p>You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone X passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that’s just the beginning.</p><p>That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.</p><p>To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the “Home” button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone X.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Advise Siri to set a reminder.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Tap the recently added reminder to open the “Reminders” application.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “Home” button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="use siri"                ></p><p>As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.</p><h3 id="5-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#5-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="5. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>5. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>The Apple iPhone X unlock software Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will help to open the password without iTunes. It is well-versed in unlocking screen locks from various iOS devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod contact. With it introduced on your PC, you can eliminate your Apple iPhone X lock screen effectively. It can remove the 4-digit password, 6-digit password, Fingerprint, or Face ID.</p><p>Therefore, Dr.Fone is a decent option if you like to sidestep the passcode on your Apple iPhone X without Siri or iTunes. To fix more issues, such as bypassing the enactment lock without the past proprietor, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will be a decent option for you. The following steps illustrate how you can unlock your lock screen passcode:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone X&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone program on your PC and select “Screen Unlock” among all the options from the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="select screen unlock"                ></p><p>Connect your iOS device to the PC through a USB connector. Then, at that point, click the “Unlock iOS Screen” option on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="unlock ios screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone X lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can’t actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="enter recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Affirm iOS device information</strong></p><p>After putting the Apple iPhone X device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone X device information, for example, the Apple iPhone X device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="select phone model"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone X screen lock</strong></p><p>After the firmware is downloaded effectively, click Unlock Now to begin unlocking your Apple iPhone X&#x2F;iPad.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="unlock now"                ></p><p>Simply shortly, your Apple iPhone X will be unlocked effectively. Note that this unlocking process will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone X. However, it is practical to erase this issue from your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Turn-Off-On-My-Passcode"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Turn-Off-On-My-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Turn Off&#x2F;On My Passcode?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Turn Off&#x2F;On My Passcode?</h2><ul><li>Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 13 mini and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 13 mini and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 13 mini in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 13 mini device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 13 mini device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.</p><p>While you can’t remove it, figuring out <strong>how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens</strong> is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device’s battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s lock screen and make it work better for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?"></a>Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?</h2><p>You can’t remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 13 mini screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13 mini device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 13 mini. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 13 mini lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 13 mini.

In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13 mini: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>.

The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 13 mini:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 mini Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 mini Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 13 mini flashlight.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="7-Ways-to-Lock-Apps-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-and-iPad-Securely"><a href="#7-Ways-to-Lock-Apps-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-and-iPad-Securely" class="headerlink" title="7 Ways to Lock Apps on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Securely"></a>7 Ways to Lock Apps on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Securely</h2><p>Are you concerned about your privacy and would like to secure certain apps on your iOS device? Don’t worry! There are plenty of ways to app lock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and protect your privacy. You can follow the same drill to restrict the usage of certain apps for your kids as well by taking the assistance of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max app lock feature. The app lock for iPhone and iPad options can be used pretty easily. There are plenty of native and third-party solutions out there that you can use. In this post, we will make you familiar with seven different techniques on how to lock apps on iPhones and iPads.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Screen-Time"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Screen-Time" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Screen Time?"></a>Part 1: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Screen Time?</h2><p>Utilizing Screen Time on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a versatile way to manage app access. It is done through time restrictions and a dedicated passcode. By implementing Screen Time settings, you can exercise control over app usage. It ensures added security and regulated access to your preferred applications. Now, let’s walk through the steps to learn <strong>how to lock apps on iPhone</strong> Screen Time:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by accessing the Settings on your iOS device and tapping on the “Screen Time” option. On the ensuing screen, tap “App Limits,” followed by “Add Limit.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the app limits option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the apps or categories of the apps, tap “Next,” and choose the “Time Limit” for the selected apps. After deciding the time limit, press “Add” from the top right corner to add an app limitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on add limit option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?"></a>Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?</h2><p>Leveraging the advanced security capabilities of Face ID or Passcode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max X or later models effectively fortifies app access. By using facial recognition or passcodes, you can put in place an extra layer of protection. It can be done for specific apps, safeguarding your sensitive data from unauthorized access. Now, let’s proceed with the detailed steps to lock apps using Face ID or Passcode on your iOS device:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> After opening the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, scroll down to access “Face ID &amp; Passcode.” Here, you will be required to provide the passcode of your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After providing the passcode, select “Other Apps” and check the apps that have Face ID enabled. Remember, you’re unable to manually include apps in the list. Only those apps that have sought access to the feature will appear here automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="access face id and passcode option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?"></a>Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?</h2><p>If you are unable to lock the targeted app directly with Face ID, there is no need to worry. There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won’t directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.</p><p>When activated, it takes you to the lock screen, prompting Face ID, Touch ID, or Passcode to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device again. Use the following steps to lock your apps using the Shortcuts app:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, launch the Shortcuts app and select the “Automation” tab from the bottom toolbar. There, tap “New Automation” and use the search bar to look for and select “App.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="choose app automation option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, tap “Choose” in front of the “App” and select the app you want to lock. Now, move down and select “Is Opened,” then move further down to choose “Run Immediately.” Here, leave “Notify when Run” deactivated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="customize app automation settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Proceed forward by tapping “Next” from the top right corner, and on the following screen, tap “New Blank Automation.” Then, press “Add Action” and enter “Lock Screen” into the Search field, then choose “Lock Screen” from the search results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="search for lock screen option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Finally, tap “Done” to finalize the shortcut. Now, upon accessing the targeted app, the shortcut will activate in the background, causing your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to be locked. You can then use the Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to unlock it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="press the done option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?"></a>Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?</h2><p>By taking the assistance of Apple’s native Restrictions feature, you can app lock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without any trouble.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 11 based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 11 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty.

While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 11 to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>, leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password"></a>Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password</h2><p>Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11 and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 11. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It’s user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.</p><p>Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:</p><ul><li>Can remove all types of locked screen</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html"><u>Remove SIM lock</u></a>&#x2F; unlock iPhone carrier without losing data</li><li>Unlock Apple ID without a password</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>Bypass MDM without data loss</u></a></li><li>Remove iTunes backup encryption</li></ul><p>Dr.Fone uses the responsible path of jailbreaking your iOS device, giving you back control.

Device Identification and Unlock Initiation</strong></li></ul><p>Now, decide whether your device is GSM or CDMA, as it is an important aspect.

A completion message will pop up on the window when the process finishes. Afterward, tap the “Done” button to finalize the process successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-9.png"                      alt="icloud activation lock successfully removed"                ></p><h4 id="2-For-Devices-Running-iOS-iPadOS-15-0-to-16-3"><a href="#2-For-Devices-Running-iOS-iPadOS-15-0-to-16-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.</p><p>Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone. Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value. Talking about iPhone, let’s discuss how a user can unlock Apple iPhone 13 without a passcode.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn6H3w08kAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-without-Passcode-or-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-without-Passcode-or-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

In the search bar, type “AutoUnlockX.” Once the tweak appears, select it, and then tap “Get (Sileo)” or “Install (Cydia).”</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Confirm the selected repo by tapping the “Confirm” option and allow the tweak to install. Once installed, tap “Restart SpringBoard” to complete the download. After your Apple iPhone 13 mini resprings, proceed to enable AutoUnlockX.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Open Settings, tap on “App,” and then select “AutoUnlockX.” Toggle on “Enable Auto Unlock.” Customize other settings as desired by tapping on them to turn them on or off.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> When finished, tap the “Respring” option at the bottom to apply your changes.

It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.</p><p>It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the <strong>Apple Store “Verification Required”</strong> prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg"                      alt="verification required page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?</h2><p>When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 13 mini or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.</p><p>The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.</p><p>What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html"><u>Touch ID</u></a> if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg"                      alt="verification required notification"                ></p><h3 id="Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear"><a href="#Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear"></a>Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear</h3><p>There are several reasons why you might see an <strong>Apple Store’ Verification</strong> <strong>Required</strong>’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:</p><ul><li><strong>New Apple ID</strong>. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.</li><li><strong>Unpaid balance</strong>. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.</li></ul><p>Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID</h2><p>Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:</p><h3 id="Update-Payment-Method"><a href="#Update-Payment-Method" class="headerlink" title="Update Payment Method"></a>Update Payment Method</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 13 mini or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the <strong>Settings app</strong>, then go to <strong>Payment &amp; Shipping</strong>. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.</p><h3 id="Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions"><a href="#Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions" class="headerlink" title="Check Unpaid Subscriptions"></a>Check Unpaid Subscriptions</h3><p>Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store &gt; your profile icon, and select <strong>Subscriptions</strong>. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg"                      alt="subscriptions page app store"                ></p><h3 id="Don’t-Require-Password-for-Purchases"><a href="#Don’t-Require-Password-for-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Require Password for Purchases"></a>Don’t Require Password for Purchases</h3><p>For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to <strong>Screen Time</strong>. Under <strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong>, select <strong>iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases</strong>. Here, you can change the settings to <strong>Don’t Require</strong> for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg"                      alt="screen time app store purchases"                ></p><h3 id="Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-and-Re-Sign-In"><a href="#Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-and-Re-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In"></a>Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In</h3><p>Sometimes, simply <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html"><u>signing out of your Apple ID</u></a> and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to <strong>Sign Out</strong>. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.</p><p>Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure.

You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.</p><p>Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you’re getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Password Check</strong></li></ul><p>Review your current passwords.

Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></li></ul><p>If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It’s simple and highly effective.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Changing your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other iOS devices is a simple process that can help you protect your privacy and information.
