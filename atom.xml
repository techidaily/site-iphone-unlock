This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS.

Follow this comprehensive guide step-by-step to set up your iOS device again using iCloud.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, open iCloud on your desktop web browser. Afterward, enter your “Apple ID” and “Password” to proceed. After trusting the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, look for the “Grid” icon on the top right to find the “Find My” option in the list.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-8.jpg"                      alt="access find my service from icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After that, choose the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device that you want to recover.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-With-Forgotten-Passcode-Different-Methods-You-Can-Try"><a href="#Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-With-Forgotten-Passcode-Different-Methods-You-Can-Try" class="headerlink" title="Unlock Apple iPhone 13 mini With Forgotten Passcode: Different Methods You Can Try"></a>Unlock Apple iPhone 13 mini With Forgotten Passcode: Different Methods You Can Try</h2><p>Have you forgotten the passcode iPhone 6? We know forgetting your Apple iPhone 13 mini passcode can be a frustrating experience, but luckily it is possible to unlock your device. Using different methods, we will show you how to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini 6 with a forgotten passcode.</p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode"></a>Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode</h2><p>Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we’ll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My iPhone"></a>1. Use Find My iPhone</h3><p>If you’ve activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn’t require any technical knowledge or special tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg"                      alt="find My Apple iPhone 13 mini"                ></p><p>Just follow the steps below and get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com&#x2F;find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “All Devices” at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 13 mini from the list of devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Erase iPhone” and confirm that you want to erase your device.</li></ul><p>Once your Apple iPhone 13 mini has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes"></a>2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone 13 mini with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 mini, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone 13 mini is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the “Restore” or “Update” appears, please choose “Restore”.</li></ul><p>iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it’s finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Siri"><a href="#3-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Siri"></a>3. Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked.

Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone’s information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 13 mini device has an activation lock enabled.</p><p>The DNS bypass will send a fake “device isn’t locked” message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 13 mini and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>:</p><ul><li>Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 13 mini, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.</li><li>A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the “I” icon.

After activating Voice Control, use a voice command to unlock your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-7.jpg"                      alt="toggle on voice control option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-6-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-with-Switch-Control"><a href="#Method-6-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-with-Switch-Control" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up with Switch Control"></a>Method 6: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up with Switch Control</h3><p>Utilizing Switch Control is an excellent accessibility feature on iOS devices. It allows users to interact with their iPhones using adaptive switches or the Apple iPhone 12 mini device’s screen itself. Moreover, it can provide an alternative way to navigate the Apple iPhone 12 mini and access the Home screen. You no longer have to rely solely on the conventional swipe gesture. Here is how you can set up switch control to <strong>iPhone swipe to unlock</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your Apple iPhone 12 mini’s Settings, then tap on “Accessibility.” Now find and select “Switch Control,” and within it, navigate to “Switches.” Now, tap “Add New Switch” and choose “Camera.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-8.jpg"                      alt="add a new switch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Set Left Head Movement and Right Head Movement separately to “Home.” This action will lock the screen when tilting your head left or right. Now go back to “Recipes” in Switch Control, select “Edit,” and delete all existing recipes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-9.jpg"                      alt="remove existing recipes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set “Scanning Style” to “Single Switch Step Scanning” and adjust “Dwell Time” to the shortest duration. Then, turn off the remaining settings under Switch Control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-10.jpg"                      alt="reduce dwell time as needed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Save your switch, return to Accessibility Settings, and locate “Accessibility Shortcut.” Now, set triple-clicking the side button to activate “Switch Control.” On the home screen, triple-click the Side button, as previously set, to activate the switch on your Apple iPhone 12 mini. Now, lock the Apple iPhone 12 mini screen and then wake the Apple iPhone 12 mini device without looking at it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-11.jpg"                      alt="set switch control as accessibility shortcut"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, we have explored different ways to <strong>unlock iPhones without swiping up</strong> beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We’ve talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.</p><p>While these methods are helpful, there’s a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that’s particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can’t get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called “Screen Unlock” that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/passfab-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-backup-unlocker-top-4-alternatives-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>PassFab Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Backup Unlocker Top 4 Alternatives | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-unlock-iphone-15-without-passcode-or-face-id-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 15 without Passcode or Face ID | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-unlock-apple-iphone-15-with-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Full Guide to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 with iTunes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-6s-with-an-apple-watch-and-what-to-do-if-it-doesnt-work-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesnt Work | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-apple-iphone-12-pro-without-passcode-easily-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro Without Passcode Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-passcode-without-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Passcode without Computer?

It’s like a digital timeout and can be a real headache. Imagine not being able to use your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max fully because it’s on a blacklist. That means no calls, texts, or internet – not exactly the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max experience you signed up for, right?</p><p>But don’t fret! This article is here to demystify the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max blacklist and show you how to fix it. It will take you on a journey of <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong>.

Decoding the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Blacklist: What You Need To</h2><p>You might have heard the term “blacklisted iPhone” before, but what does it mean? Well, it’s like your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is in a timeout and can’t play with the other phones. Let’s break it down in simple terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklisted"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone"><a href="#What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?"></a>What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?</h3><p>When an iPhone is blacklisted, it’s been labeled as “not-so-friendly” in the digital world. It’s like when you’re not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.</p><h3 id="Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted"><a href="#Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?"></a>Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?</h3><p>There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:</p><ul><li>**Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That’s because protecting the original owner’s data and privacy is essential.</li><li>**Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn’t pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.</li></ul><h3 id="What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Is-Blacklisted"><a href="#What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Is-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Is Blacklisted?"></a>What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Is Blacklisted?</h3><p>Now, here’s where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is blacklisted, it won’t work like it should. Here’s what you might experience:</p><ul><li>**No Calls or Texts.**You won’t be able to make or receive calls and texts. It’s like your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is suddenly mute.</li><li>**No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max will be like a disconnected island.</li><li>**Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, its value will drop if it’s blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.</li></ul><p>So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don’t have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max back in action with some easy-to-follow <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> steps.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free"></a>Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free</h2><p>Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let’s talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max free. The good news is there’s a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklist removal"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal"><a href="#What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal" class="headerlink" title="What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?"></a>What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?</h3><p>Going through a <strong>blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max</strong> is like giving your device a second chance. It’s taking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place. Prevention is always better than a cure, right? Here are some easy steps to make sure your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max stays in the clear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-04.jpg"                      alt="how to avoid iphone blacklist"                ></p><h3 id="Check-the-iPhone’s-History-Before-Buying"><a href="#Check-the-iPhone’s-History-Before-Buying" class="headerlink" title="Check the iPhone’s History Before Buying"></a>Check the iPhone’s History Before Buying</h3><p>Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone’s background. Make sure it’s not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone’s IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.</p><h3 id="Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Secure"><a href="#Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Secure" class="headerlink" title="Keep Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Secure"></a>Keep Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Secure</h3><p>Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.</p><h3 id="Pay-Your-Bills-on-Time"><a href="#Pay-Your-Bills-on-Time" class="headerlink" title="Pay Your Bills on Time"></a>Pay Your Bills on Time</h3><p>Your iPhone needs its “phone allowance” paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max getting blacklisted.</p><h3 id="Be-Careful-With-iCloud"><a href="#Be-Careful-With-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Be Careful With iCloud"></a>Be Careful With iCloud</h3><p>iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max’s data. Don’t share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max’s status.</p><h3 id="Report-a-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Report-a-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone"></a>Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone</h3><p>If your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.</p><h3 id="Beware-of-Scams"><a href="#Beware-of-Scams" class="headerlink" title="Beware of Scams"></a>Beware of Scams</h3><p>Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals.

You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro by implementing the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491422339.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the world clock interface, add another clock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491682149.jpg"                      alt="world clock" title="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The interface will ask you to search for a location of your choice.

Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Apple-iPhone-8-Asking-for-Passcode-after-iOS-17-14-Update-What-to-Do"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-8-Asking-for-Passcode-after-iOS-17-14-Update-What-to-Do" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 8 Asking for Passcode after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update, What to Do?"></a>Apple iPhone 8 Asking for Passcode after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update, What to Do?</h2><p>If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17&#x2F;14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 8 displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.</p><p>This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt=" ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt=" ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 8 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt=" drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 8 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 8 to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 8 in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 8 device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 8 device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!</p><h2 id="7-Ways-to-Lock-Apps-on-Apple-iPhone-8-and-iPad-Securely"><a href="#7-Ways-to-Lock-Apps-on-Apple-iPhone-8-and-iPad-Securely" class="headerlink" title="7 Ways to Lock Apps on Apple iPhone 8 and iPad Securely"></a>7 Ways to Lock Apps on Apple iPhone 8 and iPad Securely</h2><p>Are you concerned about your privacy and would like to secure certain apps on your iOS device? Don’t worry! There are plenty of ways to app lock the Apple iPhone 8 and protect your privacy. You can follow the same drill to restrict the usage of certain apps for your kids as well by taking the assistance of the Apple iPhone 8 app lock feature. The app lock for iPhone and iPad options can be used pretty easily. There are plenty of native and third-party solutions out there that you can use. In this post, we will make you familiar with seven different techniques on how to lock apps on iPhones and iPads.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Screen-Time"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Screen-Time" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Screen Time?"></a>Part 1: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Screen Time?</h2><p>Utilizing Screen Time on your Apple iPhone 8 offers a versatile way to manage app access. It is done through time restrictions and a dedicated passcode. By implementing Screen Time settings, you can exercise control over app usage. It ensures added security and regulated access to your preferred applications. Now, let’s walk through the steps to learn <strong>how to lock apps on iPhone</strong> Screen Time:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by accessing the Settings on your iOS device and tapping on the “Screen Time” option. On the ensuing screen, tap “App Limits,” followed by “Add Limit.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the app limits option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the apps or categories of the apps, tap “Next,” and choose the “Time Limit” for the selected apps. After deciding the time limit, press “Add” from the top right corner to add an app limitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on add limit option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?"></a>Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?</h2><p>Leveraging the advanced security capabilities of Face ID or Passcode on your Apple iPhone 8 X or later models effectively fortifies app access. By using facial recognition or passcodes, you can put in place an extra layer of protection. It can be done for specific apps, safeguarding your sensitive data from unauthorized access. Now, let’s proceed with the detailed steps to lock apps using Face ID or Passcode on your iOS device:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> After opening the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 8, scroll down to access “Face ID &amp; Passcode.” Here, you will be required to provide the passcode of your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After providing the passcode, select “Other Apps” and check the apps that have Face ID enabled. Remember, you’re unable to manually include apps in the list. Only those apps that have sought access to the feature will appear here automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="access face id and passcode option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?"></a>Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?</h2><p>If you are unable to lock the targeted app directly with Face ID, there is no need to worry. There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won’t directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.</p><p>When activated, it takes you to the lock screen, prompting Face ID, Touch ID, or Passcode to access the Apple iPhone 8 device again.

It might surprise you, but you can also take the assistance of Siri to unlock your phone. Most users prefer this technique, as it doesn’t require a computer and can unlock an iOS device without erasing its data.</p><p>Though, before you proceed, you need to know the limitations of this method. Since it is considered a loophole in iOS, it doesn’t always yield desirable results. It has been observed that the method only works on devices running from iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. To learn how to unlock iPad passcode without a computer, follow these stepwise instructions:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Activate Siri on your iOS device by holding the Home button. Ask for the present time by giving a command like “Hey Siri, what time is it?” to proceed. Siri will let you know the current time by displaying a clock. Tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463688829.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Tap on the Add (plus) icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463891817.jpg"                      alt="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From here, you can search for a city.

If everything goes right, you will enter the Home screen of your iOS device after unlocking it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994465721934.jpg"                      alt="iphone home" title="iphone home"                ></p><p>By following this technique, you would also learn how to unlock the disabled Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 4.

Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 8 is restricted and doesn’t support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 8 is locked or not:</p><h3 id="Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings"><a href="#Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings"></a>Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings</h3><p>To check whether your Apple iPhone 8 is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, open your Apple iPhone 8 “Settings” and tap the “General” option.

Note that if your iTunes is not synchronized with the iPhone, you risk losing your existing data. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your locked iPhone using a cable and let iTunes identify the Apple iPhone 12 device. Next, navigate to the <strong>Summary</strong> section and select the <strong>Restore iPhone</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-10.jpg"                      alt="itunes main window"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Allow iTunes to identify your device. Start the restoration of previous data by selecting <strong>Restore Backup</strong>. Your Apple iPhone 12 will be unlocked with all the associated data if you have backed up your information on iTunes. Otherwise, you will need to set it up as a new iPhone.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-3-Using-Recovery-Mode-To-Unlock-a-Locked-or-Disabled-iPhone"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Recovery-Mode-To-Unlock-a-Locked-or-Disabled-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Recovery Mode To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone"></a>Method 3: Using Recovery Mode To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone</h3><p>Activating Recovery mode is another useful method for accessing a locked phone. The approach erases all data on the phone, restoring it to factory settings. Any data not backed up will be lost using this method. Follow the steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 12 with a USB cable.</li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button. If executed, the iTunes connect screen will appear. For earlier iPhone models, you can refer to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/iphone/iph8903c3ee6/15.0"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-11.jpg"                      alt="iphone hard reset"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> iTunes will prompt you to either restore or update your Apple iPhone 12. Choose the <strong>Restore iPhone</strong> option to reset your device to its factory settings. If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 12 exits recovery mode, you’ll need to repeat the steps.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-4-Using-iCloud-To-Unlock-a-Lock-or-Disabled-iPhone"><a href="#Method-4-Using-iCloud-To-Unlock-a-Lock-or-Disabled-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone"></a>Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone</h3><p>After <strong>many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 12</strong>，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here’s how.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-12.jpg"                      alt="icloud all devices"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select <strong>All Devices</strong>, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu. Once you’ve chosen the Apple iPhone 12 device, click the <strong>Erase iPhone</strong> icon in the lower-right corner. Although the action deletes the data on the phone, you can retrieve it from your iCloud backup once the Apple iPhone 12 device is operational again.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-5-Contact-Apple-Support-or-Visit-an-Apple-Store"><a href="#Method-5-Contact-Apple-Support-or-Visit-an-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store"></a>Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store</h3><p>If all methods fail or you don’t have access to Dr.Fone, consider contacting Apple Support.

However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.</p><p>So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode?

That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.</p><p>You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone XS and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone XS device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone XS devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone XS device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.</p><h2 id="Part-III-FAQs"><a href="#Part-III-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part III: FAQs"></a>Part III: FAQs</h2><p>Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled"><a href="#FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?"></a>FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?</h3><p>iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.</p><h3 id="FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss"><a href="#FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?"></a>FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?</h3><p>Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone XS device.

And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?</p><p>A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.</p><p>If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.</p><p>But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone XS gets disabled.

Lost Mode is one feature that locks your lost iPhone or other Apple devices so nobody can get to them.</p><p>If your device is gone, you can use the Find My application on your other Apple device connected to a similar account to <strong>unlock the lost iPhone.</strong></p><p>If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is in Lost Mode and you don’t have the foggiest idea of how to restore it, relax. This guide will cover every one of the techniques that you can use for <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-Happen-When-iPhone-Is-in-Lost-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-Happen-When-iPhone-Is-in-Lost-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?"></a>Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Lock feature permits remotely locking a lost Apple iPhone 14 Pro to prevent people from using its data. If you set a password for a device before enabling the Lost Mode, you will need this password to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro once it has returned to its proprietor.</p><p>The Lost Mode menu will ask you to set one if it has no password. Password is obligatory to stop Lost Mode once a device is returned to the owner, as Contact ID or Face ID won’t work for this reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-1.jpg"                      alt="lost mode"                ></p><p><strong>Send a Custom Text Message:</strong> When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.</p><p><strong>Erase Data Remotely:</strong> Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 14 Pro if you believe it’s been some time since it’s gone and you don’t think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.</p><p><strong>Track Your Device on Map:</strong> An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.</p><p><strong>Play Songs:</strong> Playing a sound might assist you with finding your lost iPhone if it’s still close by. The Apple iPhone 14 Pro will play a sound at top volume, no matter what volume level was set on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device when you lost it.</p><h3 id="1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode"><a href="#1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode" class="headerlink" title="1. Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode"></a>1. Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode</h3><p>The most straightforward method for unlocking the Apple iPhone 14 Pro in Lost Mode is entering the password on the actual device. If your device was protected with a password before placing it in Lost Mode, enter it again.</p><p>If your device had no password while placing it in Lost Mode and you’ve entered it into iCloud while placing your Apple iPhone 14 Pro into Lost Mode, utilize this password. That will help you <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>, and you can start operating your Apple iPhone 14 Pro again.</p><h3 id="2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove it from Find My in iCloud"></a>2. Remove it from Find My in iCloud</h3><p>One more method for unlocking the Lost Mode on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is to utilize the Find My iPhone application on the official iCloud site. Follow the steps underneath to do so:</p><ol><li>Go to &lt;<a href="http://www.icloud.com>">www.icloud.com&gt;</a> and utilize your account details to sign in.</li><li>Click the “Find My iPhone” button and select all iDevices.</li><li>Pick the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you need to unlock in Lost Mode and tap the “Lost Mode” button.</li><li>Click the “Stop Lost Mode” button to remove the lock from the phone.</li><li>Confirm this activity by clicking the “Stop Lost Mode” button again.</li></ol><h3 id="3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone’s information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has an activation lock enabled.</p><p>The DNS bypass will send a fake “device isn’t locked” message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>:</p><ul><li>Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.</li><li>A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the “I” icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap “Forget this Network.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on “Configure DNS,” and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:</li></ul><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p><p>Asia: 104.155.28.90</p><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p><ul><li>Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network. Click the Back button when a popup says that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is attempting to connect to the Apple servers.</li><li>You will now be on the DNS bypass screen. Pick the applications from the list to keep using your device. However, only a handful of applications are available through this.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Use-Emergency-Call"><a href="#4-Use-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Emergency Call"></a>4. Use Emergency Call</h3><p>This technique is the most widely recognized one. You can bypass your iCloud activation by settling on a fake Emergency call. Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won’t work for everyone.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:</strong></p><ul><li>Click the “Emergency Call” option on your locked device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg"                      alt="emergency call"                ></p><ul><li>Dial “*#96274825*0000*1#,” then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.</li><li>If it’s not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn’t work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.</li><li>Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again. Now create a new password after <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="5. Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>5. Apple iPhone Unlock</h3><p>Apple iPhone Unlock is a site that can assist you with <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock</strong>.

The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on.
