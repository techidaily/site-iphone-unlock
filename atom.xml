Even before the days of smartphones, we were using AOL to chat with friends and send pictures to one another. Most people who have AOL email accounts don’t want to get rid of them since they’ve had them for so long.</p><p> While other people are moving to Gmail and other popular platforms, AOL still maintains a loyal customer base. Like Gmail, AOL also has a specific app for its service. However, some users report having issues with the AOL app on occasion.</p><p>If the AOL app isn’t working on your iPhone, try these fixes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Hard-Restart-the-AOL-App"><a href="#1-Hard-Restart-the-AOL-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Hard Restart the AOL App"></a>1. Hard Restart the AOL App</h2><p> The first and easiest fix for the AOL app is to do a hard restart. A hard restart means closing the app, and all other apps you have opened, and opening the AOL app again.</p><p> Sometimes we exit out of the app thinking it closed, but it’s still running in the background. To do a hard reset, swipe up from the bottom of the screen and swipe the app off the top. If you have an iPhone with a Home button, double-click the Home button instead, then swipe the app up. This assures that the app closes.</p><p> Be sure to do this for all other apps open at the same time, as sometimes another app can conflict with the AOL app.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/verizon-selling-yahoo-aol/" >Verizon Is Selling Yahoo and AOL for $5 Billion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Alternatively, you can turn your device off and on again. This will clear it up just as efficiently.</p><h2 id="2-Remove-and-Reinstate-Your-AOL-Account"><a href="#2-Remove-and-Reinstate-Your-AOL-Account" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove and Reinstate Your AOL Account"></a>2. Remove and Reinstate Your AOL Account</h2><p> Sometimes, there might be an issue with your AOL account. For example, if you recently changed your password, it may not have updated in the AOL app. In which case, you’ll need to remove and update your AOL account to fix it.</p><p> There are also some cases where your account might not be loading due to an app error; removing and replacing your account can resolve this.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/my-aol-mail-login-screen-name/" >What’s My AOL Mail Login Screen Name? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To do this, open the<strong>AOL</strong> app and tap the AOL logo in the top-left corner.

Reset Multiple Accounts Through Settings"></a>3. Reset Multiple Accounts Through Settings</h2><p> If you have multiple AOL accounts in the AOL app, it might be cumbersome to remove each one individually. Luckily, there is a way to reset all the accounts at once. Sometimes, this can resolve any issues you’re having with the app as well.</p><p> To do this, open<strong>Settings</strong> and scroll down until you see AOL. Once here, tap<strong>AOL</strong> and select<strong>Reset All Accounts</strong> . This will reset your accounts within the app. You’ll then have to log back in and sign in to each one individually.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/aol-reset-accounts.jpg"                      alt="aol reset accounts"                ></p><h2 id="4-Update-the-AOL-App"><a href="#4-Update-the-AOL-App" class="headerlink" title="4.

Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the Apple iPhone 6 device. When you set the Apple iPhone 6 device up again, if you set it to use iCloud, data such as Contacts, iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive data, etc. will be downloaded onto your device again. The apps you had on your Apple iPhone 6 prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the Apple iPhone 6 device again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder"><a href="#Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Using iTunes or macOS Finder"></a>Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Using iTunes or macOS Finder</h2><p>Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 6 to a Windows&#x2F; macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 6 and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 6) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 6 and unlock your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 6 reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 is using the iCloud website to gain access back.

In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 6, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6.</p><p>Step 1: Visit <em><a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> and log in into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 6.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my iphone"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 6 remotely and your Apple iPhone 6 will be reset to factory settings.

This method is particularly useful if you’re traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="find my on macos"                ></p><p>Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 6 from the Apple iPhone 6 devices from the left pane, click&#x2F; tap your disabled Apple iPhone 6 and click&#x2F; tap Erase This Device</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings.

They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6 with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 and return the Apple iPhone 6 device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6 is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 6 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 6 easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 6 again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 6 disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 6 device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-the-secrets-to-flawless-lenovo-screen-recordings/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unveiling the Secrets to Flawless Lenovo Screen Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-wave-goodbye-to-breakups-keep-your-streak-going/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Wave Goodbye to Breakups  Keep Your Streak Going</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/hannel-conversion-secrets-yt-vs-igtv-for-2024/"><u>[New] Channel Conversion Secrets  YT Vs IGTV for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-superior-choices-4k-screen-recorder-programs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Superior Choices  4K Screen Recorder Programs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-insta-experts-reveal-unknown-functions-and-features/"><u>[New] Insta-Experts Reveal Unknown Functions and Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-boosting-your-brand-on-instagram-proven-5-techniques-and-success-stories/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Boosting Your Brand on Instagram  Proven 5 Techniques & Success Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-leveraging-instagrams-music-icon-feature-effectively/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Leveraging Instagram’s Music Icon Feature Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-missing-fb-watch-icon-get-it-fixed-now/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Missing FB Watch Icon?

Users need to learn unlocking methods that seek greater flexibility and control over their phones.</p><p>In this article, we go through the essence of <strong>unlocking a Total Wireless phone</strong>. Our focus is to present a comprehensive overview of the methods and essential details required to unlock your device. It will enable users to make informed decisions and achieve the best possible results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/details-to-discuss-while-unlocking-total-wireless-phone-1.jpg"                      alt="unlock your total wireless phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Defining-The-Total-Wireless-Phone-Terminology"><a href="#Part-1-Defining-The-Total-Wireless-Phone-Terminology" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Defining The Total Wireless Phone Terminology"></a>Part 1. Defining The Total Wireless Phone Terminology</h2><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.totalbyverizon.com/" >Total Wireless <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> phone refers to a mobile device that operates on the Total Wireless network. It is a prepaid mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that uses Verizon’s network infrastructure. These phones are often sold with Total Wireless plans. Moreover, they are optimized to function within its network coverage area. Unlocking a Total Wireless phone can pose challenges due to the Apple iPhone 6 device’s association with a specific carrier.</p><p>The difficulty level largely depends on factors such as the phone model, contract status, and carrier policies. <strong>Unlock Total Wireless iPhone</strong> is indeed feasible under specific conditions. Even so, the procedure might not follow a direct path and is subject to variation on various factors. Like its counterparts, Total Wireless presents distinct guidelines and eligibility criteria for phone unlocking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/details-to-discuss-while-unlocking-total-wireless-phone-2.jpg"                      alt="total wireless phone service"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Looking-out-the-Reasons-for-Unlocking-a-Total-Wireless-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-Looking-out-the-Reasons-for-Unlocking-a-Total-Wireless-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Looking out the Reasons for Unlocking a Total Wireless Phone"></a>Part 2. Looking out the Reasons for Unlocking a Total Wireless Phone</h2><p>Understanding the details of unlocking a Total Wireless phone opens up many compelling reasons to pursue this task. It enables users to bypass limitations and enjoy the benefits of a more liberated mobile experience. Given below are some of the many reasons why you should go for <strong>unlocking a Total Wireless phone</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Switching Carriers:</strong> Total Wireless phones are often locked to their network, which limits users to their services. <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html" >Unlocking allows users to switch to other carriers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for better plans, coverage, or services that suit their needs.</li><li><strong>International Travel:</strong> On Total Wireless, international roaming options might be limited or expensive. Unlocking the phone enables the use of local SIM cards abroad. This offers more cost-effective communication options during travel.</li><li><strong>Network Compatibility:</strong> Total Wireless phones don’t work with other carriers due to specific network configurations. Unlocking enables these devices to work with a broader range of networks, enhancing usability.</li></ol><h3 id="Advantages-of-Unlocking-a-Total-Wireless-Device"><a href="#Advantages-of-Unlocking-a-Total-Wireless-Device" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Unlocking a Total Wireless Device"></a>Advantages of Unlocking a Total Wireless Device</h3><p>Unlocking a Total Wireless phone opens up a lot of advantages. Here are a few of the benefits associated with <strong>unlocking Total Wireless iPhone</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The freedom to select among different carriers, plans, and services is offered by unlocked phones. It grants users increased flexibility in handling their communication requirements.</li><li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Switching to more affordable or better-suited plans from different carriers can result in cost savings. This is especially true for users with specific usage patterns or travel requirements.</li><li><strong>Improved Resale Value:</strong> Unlocked phones generally have higher demand in the resale market. It appeals to a wider range of buyers and potentially fetching better prices.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/details-to-discuss-while-unlocking-total-wireless-phone-3.jpg"                      alt="looking into unlocking total wireless"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Check-if-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Is-Already-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Check-if-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Is-Already-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How To Check if Your Apple iPhone 6 Is Already Unlocked?</h2><p>No need to worry if you’re unsure whether your Total Wireless device is unlocked. You can easily verify its status through a simple SIM test. Here’s a straightforward set of steps to check if your <strong>iPhone Total Wireless unlock</strong> is already unlocked:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Turn off your device and remove the SIM tray to start. Swap the current SIM card for one from a different carrier and position it in the tray. Reinsert the tray into your device and power it on again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/details-to-discuss-while-unlocking-total-wireless-phone-4.jpg"                      alt="changing sim to check status"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> First, check to see if the SIM card is getting network service. Attempting a call or sending an SMS are alternative methods to test whether your phone is unlocked. If it fails, it suggests that your phone might still be locked to Total Wireless.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-A-Small-Checklist-to-Ensure-Before-Unlocking-Your-Total-Wireless-Phone"><a href="#Part-4-A-Small-Checklist-to-Ensure-Before-Unlocking-Your-Total-Wireless-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The iCloud Activation binds an Apple device to a user’s Apple ID, making itself a great security measure.

Installation and iCloud Activation Lock Removal</strong></li></ul><p>Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the “Toolbox” tab, navigate to “Screen Unlock” and select “iOS.” In the following window, choose “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” and click “Start” to begin the process and receive a prompt to connect your iOS device. Once connected, the window will display the progress status.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="proceed with icloud activation lock removal"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.

Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device won’t affect the Apple iPhone 6 device. However, running this process on a CDMA device will result in a loss of cellular activities. Click “Unlock Now” to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you’ll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click “Got It!” after agreeing with all the mentioned points.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->![start to unlock device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-4.png)<ul><li><strong>Step 3.

Well, it’s like your Apple iPhone 6 is in a timeout and can’t play with the other phones. Let’s break it down in simple terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklisted"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone"><a href="#What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?"></a>What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?</h3><p>When an iPhone is blacklisted, it’s been labeled as “not-so-friendly” in the digital world. It’s like when you’re not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone 6 has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.</p><h3 id="Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted"><a href="#Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?"></a>Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?</h3><p>There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:</p><ul><li>**Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That’s because protecting the original owner’s data and privacy is essential.</li><li>**Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn’t pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.</li></ul><h3 id="What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Is-Blacklisted"><a href="#What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Is-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 6 Is Blacklisted?"></a>What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 6 Is Blacklisted?</h3><p>Now, here’s where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone 6 is blacklisted, it won’t work like it should. Here’s what you might experience:</p><ul><li>**No Calls or Texts.**You won’t be able to make or receive calls and texts. It’s like your Apple iPhone 6 is suddenly mute.</li><li>**No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 6 will be like a disconnected island.</li><li>**Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 6, its value will drop if it’s blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.</li></ul><p>So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don’t have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 6 back in action with some easy-to-follow <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> steps.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 6. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 6 device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?</p><p>A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.</p><p>If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.</p><p>But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 6 gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone? The ways outlined in this guide will help you unlock your disabled iPhone.</p><h2 id="Apple-iPhone-6-Asking-for-Passcode-after-iOS-17-14-Update-What-to-Do"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-6-Asking-for-Passcode-after-iOS-17-14-Update-What-to-Do" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 6 Asking for Passcode after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update, What to Do?"></a>Apple iPhone 6 Asking for Passcode after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update, What to Do?</h2><p>If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17&#x2F;14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 6 displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.</p><p>This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 6 to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 6 in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 6 device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 6 device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.</p><p>While you can’t remove it, figuring out <strong>how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens</strong> is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device’s battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 6’s lock screen and make it work better for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?"></a>Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?</h2><p>You can’t remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 6 screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 6 device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 6. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 6 lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 6. Even if you’ve applied Part 1’s solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 6: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>. It’s usually located in the bottom left corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 6:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 6’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6 Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6 Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 6 flashlight.

When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 6 or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 6 or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 6 device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 6.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step.

Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone 6, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode.</p><p>There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone’s stock features like Find My Apple iPhone 6 or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 lock screen.</p><p>So, let’s get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 lock screen.</p><h2 id="4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes"><a href="#Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes"></a>Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 6 passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="using itunes to unlock iphone"                ></p><p>Follow the steps to do this.</p><ol><li>First, connect your Apple iPhone 6 to your computer and launch iTunes.

For installation, <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes" >click here and download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.</li><li>Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone 6’s specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named <strong>Restore iPhone</strong>.</li><li>By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone 6, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 XR lock screen without any passcode.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone"></a>Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone</h3><p>If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven’t used iTunes before, we have another solution.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 6 to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 6 in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 6 device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 6 device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Most-Effective-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-in-Lost-Mode"><a href="#5-Most-Effective-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-in-Lost-Mode" class="headerlink" title="5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 in Lost Mode"></a>5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 in Lost Mode</h2><p>Numerous security features make all Mac devices like iPhones, iPads, and Macs stand apart from the opposition in terms of user data safety. Lost Mode is one feature that locks your lost iPhone or other Apple devices so nobody can get to them.</p><p>If your device is gone, you can use the Find My application on your other Apple device connected to a similar account to <strong>unlock the lost iPhone.</strong></p><p>If your Apple iPhone 6 is in Lost Mode and you don’t have the foggiest idea of how to restore it, relax. This guide will cover every one of the techniques that you can use for <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-Happen-When-iPhone-Is-in-Lost-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-Happen-When-iPhone-Is-in-Lost-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?"></a>Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 6 Lock feature permits remotely locking a lost Apple iPhone 6 to prevent people from using its data. If you set a password for a device before enabling the Lost Mode, you will need this password to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 once it has returned to its proprietor.</p><p>The Lost Mode menu will ask you to set one if it has no password. Password is obligatory to stop Lost Mode once a device is returned to the owner, as Contact ID or Face ID won’t work for this reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-1.jpg"                      alt="lost mode"                ></p><p><strong>Send a Custom Text Message:</strong> When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.</p><p><strong>Erase Data Remotely:</strong> Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 6 if you believe it’s been some time since it’s gone and you don’t think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.</p><p><strong>Track Your Device on Map:</strong> An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p><strong>Play Songs:</strong> Playing a sound might assist you with finding your lost iPhone if it’s still close by. The Apple iPhone 6 will play a sound at top volume, no matter what volume level was set on the Apple iPhone 6 device when you lost it.</p><h3 id="1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode"><a href="#1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode" class="headerlink" title="1. Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode"></a>1. Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode</h3><p>The most straightforward method for unlocking the Apple iPhone 6 in Lost Mode is entering the password on the actual device. If your device was protected with a password before placing it in Lost Mode, enter it again.</p><p>If your device had no password while placing it in Lost Mode and you’ve entered it into iCloud while placing your Apple iPhone 6 into Lost Mode, utilize this password. That will help you <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>, and you can start operating your Apple iPhone 6 again.</p><h3 id="2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove it from Find My in iCloud"></a>2. Remove it from Find My in iCloud</h3><p>One more method for unlocking the Lost Mode on your Apple iPhone 6 is to utilize the Find My iPhone application on the official iCloud site. Follow the steps underneath to do so:</p><ol><li>Go to &lt;<a href="http://www.icloud.com>">www.icloud.com&gt;</a> and utilize your account details to sign in.</li><li>Click the “Find My iPhone” button and select all iDevices.</li><li>Pick the Apple iPhone 6 device you need to unlock in Lost Mode and tap the “Lost Mode” button.</li><li>Click the “Stop Lost Mode” button to remove the lock from the phone.</li><li>Confirm this activity by clicking the “Stop Lost Mode” button again.</li></ol><h3 id="3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone’s information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 6 device has an activation lock enabled.</p><p>The DNS bypass will send a fake “device isn’t locked” message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 6 and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>:</p><ul><li>Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 6, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.</li><li>A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the “I” icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap “Forget this Network.”</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on “Configure DNS,” and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:</li></ul><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p><p>Asia: 104.155.28.90</p><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p><ul><li>Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network.

Use Emergency Call</h3><p>This technique is the most widely recognized one. You can bypass your iCloud activation by settling on a fake Emergency call. Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won’t work for everyone.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 6 is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:</strong></p><ul><li>Click the “Emergency Call” option on your locked device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg"                      alt="emergency call"                ></p><ul><li>Dial “*#96274825*0000*1#,” then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.</li><li>If it’s not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn’t work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.</li><li>Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again. Now create a new password after <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="5. Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>5. Apple iPhone Unlock</h3><p>Apple iPhone Unlock is a site that can assist you with <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock</strong>. You must give them your Apple iPhone 6’s IMEI and model number to get their services.</p><p>The benefit of Apple iPhone Unlock is that they keep themselves updated with the latest technology. They are educated regarding their tool’s advancement by giving updates every time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-4.jpg"                      alt="apple iphone unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Critical Features of Apple iPhone Unlock:</strong></p><ul><li>As per their site, Apple iPhone Unlock can work with every one of the Apple iPhone 6 devices going from iPhone 4 to iPhone 14 Pro Max.</li><li>Don’t bother downloading anything to your PC or phone like others.

In this case, we strongly suggest you use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is a reliable tool and has been in the market for a long time. Professional unlock service providers use it because of its ease of use and clean interface.</p><p>So, without looking any further, download this tool for a remarkable unlocking experience. The methods below will guide you into unlocking your Apple iPhone 6 within no time:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 6&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone software and tap the “Unlock iOS Screen.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery&#x2F;DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before bypassing the Apple iPhone 6 lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen guidelines. The Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. However, if you can’t activate the Recovery mode, you can figure out how to activate the DFU mode from their official site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Affirm Device Information</strong></p><p>After getting the phone in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 6 device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 6 model and other data. You can choose the right information from the dropdown menu if the information isn’t right. Then, at that point, download the firmware for your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="device information"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.

Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 6 device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 6 device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 6 device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 6 device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 6 device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 6 device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 6 device will remain locked to the previous owner’s iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-6-Locked-to-Owner-Security"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-6-Locked-to-Owner-Security" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 6 Locked to Owner Security"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 6 Locked to Owner Security</h2><p>Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner’s security can be frustrating. That’s why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to <strong><strong>bypass the Apple iPhone 6 locked to the owner for free</strong></strong>. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-6-device"><a href="#Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-6-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 6 device"></a>Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 6 device</h3><p>If you’ve recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.</p><p>To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 6 device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 6:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step:</strong></strong> Access your locked iPhone and tap “Unlock with Passcode.” On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg"                      alt="tap unlock with passcode"                ></p></li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-6-device-Using-iCloud"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-6-device-Using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 6 device Using iCloud"></a>Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 6 device Using iCloud</h3><p>The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn’t remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.</p><p>To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 6:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Access the iCloud website on your computer’s browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the “Find My” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg"                      alt="select find my feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 6 from “All Devices.” Now choose “Erase iPhone” from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 6 device and remove the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on erase iphone"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-6-Locked-to-Owner"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-6-Locked-to-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 6 Locked to Owner"></a>Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 6 Locked to Owner</h3><p>When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 6 device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 6 to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.</p><p>The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 6 device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Activation Lock:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 6 is already powered on.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 6 and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads.

You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 6 device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 6 devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 6 device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults.
