As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 14 Plus that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 14 Plus currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-X-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-X-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 14 Plus X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 14 Plus from being unlocked by thieves"></a>Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 14 Plus X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 14 Plus from being unlocked by thieves</h2><p>It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 14 Plus from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Plus without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

It is done through time restrictions and a dedicated passcode. By implementing Screen Time settings, you can exercise control over app usage. It ensures added security and regulated access to your preferred applications. Now, let’s walk through the steps to learn <strong>how to lock apps on iPhone</strong> Screen Time:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by accessing the Settings on your iOS device and tapping on the “Screen Time” option. On the ensuing screen, tap “App Limits,” followed by “Add Limit.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the app limits option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the apps or categories of the apps, tap “Next,” and choose the “Time Limit” for the selected apps. After deciding the time limit, press “Add” from the top right corner to add an app limitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on add limit option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?"></a>Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?</h2><p>Leveraging the advanced security capabilities of Face ID or Passcode on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus X or later models effectively fortifies app access. By using facial recognition or passcodes, you can put in place an extra layer of protection. It can be done for specific apps, safeguarding your sensitive data from unauthorized access. Now, let’s proceed with the detailed steps to lock apps using Face ID or Passcode on your iOS device:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> After opening the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, scroll down to access “Face ID &amp; Passcode.” Here, you will be required to provide the passcode of your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After providing the passcode, select “Other Apps” and check the apps that have Face ID enabled. Remember, you’re unable to manually include apps in the list. Only those apps that have sought access to the feature will appear here automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="access face id and passcode option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?"></a>Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?</h2><p>If you are unable to lock the targeted app directly with Face ID, there is no need to worry. There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won’t directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.</p><p>When activated, it takes you to the lock screen, prompting Face ID, Touch ID, or Passcode to access the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device again. Use the following steps to lock your apps using the Shortcuts app:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, launch the Shortcuts app and select the “Automation” tab from the bottom toolbar. There, tap “New Automation” and use the search bar to look for and select “App.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="choose app automation option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, tap “Choose” in front of the “App” and select the app you want to lock. Now, move down and select “Is Opened,” then move further down to choose “Run Immediately.” Here, leave “Notify when Run” deactivated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="customize app automation settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Proceed forward by tapping “Next” from the top right corner, and on the following screen, tap “New Blank Automation.” Then, press “Add Action” and enter “Lock Screen” into the Search field, then choose “Lock Screen” from the search results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="search for lock screen option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Finally, tap “Done” to finalize the shortcut. Now, upon accessing the targeted app, the shortcut will activate in the background, causing your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to be locked. You can then use the Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to unlock it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="press the done option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?"></a>Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?</h2><p>By taking the assistance of Apple’s native Restrictions feature, you can app lock the Apple iPhone 14 Plus without any trouble.

To provide added security, you can set up a passcode that is not similar to your lock screen passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can set up an app lock for iPhone using Restrictions. Simply go to General &gt; Restrictions and turn this feature on for any app of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060135059851.jpg"                      alt="turn on restrictions for the app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If you want, then you can also switch this feature off for any app using the same method.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-withoutScreen-Locks-PIN-pattern-fingerprints-face"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-withoutScreen-Locks-PIN-pattern-fingerprints-face" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock iPhone withoutScreen Locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face)"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock iPhone withoutScreen Locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face)</h3><p>It can be a trouble if you forget your Apple iPhone 14 Plus passcode since there are many restrictions on using iPhone.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 14 Plus based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 14 Plus from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 14 Plus’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, making it unusable.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 7 to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 7 device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-7"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-7" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 7 and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 7) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 7 and unlock your Apple iPhone 7.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 7 reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-7-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-7-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 7 Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 7 Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 7 is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn’t require going through complex hoops.</p><p>Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 7, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 7.</p><p>Step 1: Visit <em><a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> and log in into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 7.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 7.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my iphone"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 7 remotely and your Apple iPhone 7 will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 7 once again.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-7-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App"><a href="#Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-7-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 7 Using Find My iPhone App"></a>Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 7 Using Find My iPhone App</h2><p>There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 7. This method is particularly useful if you’re traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 7.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="find my on macos"                ></p><p>Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 7 from the Apple iPhone 7 devices from the left pane, click&#x2F; tap your disabled Apple iPhone 7 and click&#x2F; tap Erase This Device</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-7-Without-A-Computer"><a href="#Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-7-Without-A-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 7 Without A Computer"></a>Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 7 Without A Computer</h2><p>There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 7 with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 7 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 7.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 7 and return the Apple iPhone 7 device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 7 is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 7 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 7 easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 7 again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 7, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 7 disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 7 device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-flamegrab-ff-extras/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Flamegrab FF Extras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-masterfb-mp4-hacking-facebook-videos-with-ease/"><u>[New] In 2024, MasterFB-MP4 Hacking Facebook Videos with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-rewind-and-play-instagrams-backwards-videos-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] Rewind and Play Instagram's Backwards Videos Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capturing-still-moments-from-clips-on-windows-11/"><u>2024 Approved Capturing Still Moments From Clips on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-living-narratives-interactive-vr-storytelling/"><u>2024 Approved Living Narratives Interactive VR Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-iphone-passcode-again-unlock-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-without-passcode-now-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Forgot iPhone Passcode Again?

However, if you want to achieve the same result the Apple way, do the following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Apple iPhone 14 Plus to the computer with the cable and launch iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina and above).</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the volume up key on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and release.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults.

You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone 8 by implementing the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491422339.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the world clock interface, add another clock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491682149.jpg"                      alt="world clock" title="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The interface will ask you to search for a location of your choice.

Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 8 to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 8 device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-8"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-8" class="headerlink" title="1.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148635/16836" target="_top" id="2148635">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148635" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148635/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13 device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 13. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 13 lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 13. Even if you’ve applied Part 1’s solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>. It’s usually located in the bottom left corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 13:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 13’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-13-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-13-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 13 flashlight.

The apps you had on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder"><a href="#Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iTunes or macOS Finder"></a>Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iTunes or macOS Finder</h2><p>Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to a Windows&#x2F; macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 14 Plus reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn’t require going through complex hoops.</p><p>Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>Step 1: Visit <em><a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> and log in into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my iphone"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus remotely and your Apple iPhone 14 Plus will be reset to factory settings.

This method is particularly useful if you’re traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="find my on macos"                ></p><p>Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus from the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices from the left pane, click&#x2F; tap your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus and click&#x2F; tap Erase This Device</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings.

They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus and return the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 14 Plus easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 14 Plus again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="How-To-Remove-Passcode-From-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Complete-Guide"><a href="#How-To-Remove-Passcode-From-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Complete-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How To Remove Passcode From Apple iPhone 14 Plus?

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device off.

Checking the Network Connection</h3><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html"><u>Network inconsistencies</u></a> can often disrupt the authentication process.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.
