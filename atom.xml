It’s taking your Apple iPhone SE off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone SE is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone SE ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone SE. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone SE device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone SE and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone SE device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone SE devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone SE device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.</p><h2 id="Part-III-FAQs"><a href="#Part-III-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part III: FAQs"></a>Part III: FAQs</h2><p>Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled"><a href="#FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?"></a>FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?</h3><p>iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.</p><h3 id="FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss"><a href="#FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?"></a>FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?</h3><p>Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone SE device.

How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?</p><p>A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.</p><p>If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.</p><p>But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone SE gets disabled.

The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work.

You will learn the benefits and drawbacks of an unlocked iPhone 15 Pro. It will also discuss how to check whether your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked or not, along with how to unlock a locked iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Unlocked-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Unlocked-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Unlocked iPhone 15?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Unlocked iPhone 15?</h2><p>An unlocked smartphone, in essence, is a device that isn’t tied to a specific carrier or network. Locked phones come pre-configured to work only with a particular carrier’s SIM card. In comparison, unlocked phones provide users with the freedom to choose their preferred carrier. It also means they can switch between networks at will.</p><p>The Apple iPhone 15 Plus 15 Series is renowned for its integration of cutting-edge technology. However, what truly sets the unlocked iPhone 15 Series apart is its unlocked status. It enables users to take control of their network choices and redefine their connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-an-Unlocked-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-an-Unlocked-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Buying an Unlocked iPhone 15?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Buying an Unlocked iPhone 15?</h2><p>Purchasing an unlocked iPhone 15 isn’t just about owning a high-end smartphone. It is a strategic decision that unlocks a plethora of advantages tailored to the modern user. Below are some compelling benefits that come with opting for an <strong>unlocked iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>:</p><h3 id="1-Network-Freedom"><a href="#1-Network-Freedom" class="headerlink" title="1. Network Freedom"></a>1. Network Freedom</h3><p>One of the standout advantages of an unlocked iPhone 15 is the freedom to choose any carrier. Users can easily switch between carriers. It allows them to select the one that offers the best coverage, pricing, and customer service. Thus, avoiding being restricted to a particular carrier’s offerings.</p><h3 id="2-Global-Accessibility"><a href="#2-Global-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Global Accessibility"></a>2. Global Accessibility</h3><p>Unlocked iPhones are a traveler’s dream. With an unlocked device, you can insert a local SIM card when abroad. It lets you sidestep the exorbitant international roaming charges. This feature allows you to maintain connectivity without constraints. This makes it an ideal companion for international adventurers.</p><h3 id="3-No-Contracts"><a href="#3-No-Contracts" class="headerlink" title="3. No Contracts"></a>3. No Contracts</h3><p>Locked smartphones often come with binding carrier contracts. These can extend for two years or more. With an unlocked iPhone 15, you can avoid lengthy contracts. It puts you in control of your financial commitments and enables you to change your plan as you see fit.</p><h3 id="4-Resale-Value"><a href="#4-Resale-Value" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, it’s essential to approach any decision with a balanced perspective. Given below are the potential drawbacks associated with purchasing an <strong>iPhone 15 Pro unlocked</strong>:</p><h3 id="1-Higher-Upfront-Cost"><a href="#1-Higher-Upfront-Cost" class="headerlink" title="1. Higher Upfront Cost"></a>1. Higher Upfront Cost</h3><p>Unlocked iPhones often come with a higher upfront cost compared to locked devices. This is because carriers subsidize locked phones to some extent. Moreover, it allows them to offer lower initial prices in exchange for long-term contracts.</p><h3 id="2-Limited-Trade-In-Options"><a href="#2-Limited-Trade-In-Options" class="headerlink" title="2. Limited Trade-In Options"></a>2. Limited Trade-In Options</h3><p>Some carriers offer trade-in programs for older phones when you upgrade to a new device. These programs might be more limited for unlocked devices. This can potentially affect your ability to offset the cost of a new phone.</p><h3 id="3-No-Carrier-Support-for-Technical-Issues"><a href="#3-No-Carrier-Support-for-Technical-Issues" class="headerlink" title="3.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.</p><h2 id="Part-III-FAQs"><a href="#Part-III-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part III: FAQs"></a>Part III: FAQs</h2><p>Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled"><a href="#FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?"></a>FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?</h3><p>iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.</p><h3 id="FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss"><a href="#FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?"></a>FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?</h3><p>Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. All data on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device will be deleted in the process. There is currently no way to unlock disabled iPhone without data loss.</p><h3 id="FAQ-3-How-to-restore-data-via-iCloud"><a href="#FAQ-3-How-to-restore-data-via-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 3: How to restore data via iCloud?"></a>FAQ 3: How to restore data via iCloud?</h3><p>After unlocking the disabled iPhone, when you set it up again, if you previously had iCloud Backup enabled, you will get the option to restore data from the latest backup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="icloud"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-In-Future"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-In-Future" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled In Future"></a>Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled In Future</h2><p>By now, you know that should the Apple iPhone 15 Plus be disabled for any reason, unlocking the disabled iPhone is a process that will wipe the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device clean. And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?</p><p>A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.</p><p>If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.</p><p>But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone? The ways outlined in this guide will help you unlock your disabled iPhone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-disabled-apple-iphone-15-without-itunes-in-5-ways-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Without iTunes in 5 Ways | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-locked-iphone-7-plus-password-learn-the-best-methods-to-unlock-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Forgot Locked iPhone 7 Plus Password?

Let’s break it down in simple terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklisted"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone"><a href="#What-Is-a-Blacklisted-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?"></a>What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?</h3><p>When an iPhone is blacklisted, it’s been labeled as “not-so-friendly” in the digital world. It’s like when you’re not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone XS has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.</p><h3 id="Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted"><a href="#Why-Does-an-iPhone-Get-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?"></a>Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?</h3><p>There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:</p><ul><li>**Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That’s because protecting the original owner’s data and privacy is essential.</li><li>**Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn’t pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.</li></ul><h3 id="What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS-Is-Blacklisted"><a href="#What-Happens-When-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS-Is-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="What Happens When Your Apple iPhone XS Is Blacklisted?"></a>What Happens When Your Apple iPhone XS Is Blacklisted?</h3><p>Now, here’s where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone XS is blacklisted, it won’t work like it should. Here’s what you might experience:</p><ul><li>**No Calls or Texts.**You won’t be able to make or receive calls and texts. It’s like your Apple iPhone XS is suddenly mute.</li><li>**No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone XS will be like a disconnected island.</li><li>**Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone XS, its value will drop if it’s blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.</li></ul><p>So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don’t have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone XS back in action with some easy-to-follow <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> steps.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Remove-and-Unlock-an-iPhone-Blacklist-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free"></a>Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free</h2><p>Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone XS to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let’s talk about how to set your Apple iPhone XS free. The good news is there’s a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone blacklist removal"                ></p><h3 id="What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal"><a href="#What-Is-iPhone-Blacklisted-Removal" class="headerlink" title="What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?"></a>What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?</h3><p>Going through a <strong>blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone XS</strong> is like giving your device a second chance. It’s taking your Apple iPhone XS off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone XS is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone XS ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone XS. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone XS device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

Make sure it’s not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone’s IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.</p><h3 id="Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS-Secure"><a href="#Keep-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS-Secure" class="headerlink" title="Keep Your Apple iPhone XS Secure"></a>Keep Your Apple iPhone XS Secure</h3><p>Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone XS.

On the ensuing screen, tap “App Limits,” followed by “Add Limit.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the app limits option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the apps or categories of the apps, tap “Next,” and choose the “Time Limit” for the selected apps. After deciding the time limit, press “Add” from the top right corner to add an app limitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on add limit option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?"></a>Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?</h2><p>Leveraging the advanced security capabilities of Face ID or Passcode on your Apple iPhone XR X or later models effectively fortifies app access. By using facial recognition or passcodes, you can put in place an extra layer of protection. It can be done for specific apps, safeguarding your sensitive data from unauthorized access. Now, let’s proceed with the detailed steps to lock apps using Face ID or Passcode on your iOS device:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> After opening the Settings app on your Apple iPhone XR, scroll down to access “Face ID &amp; Passcode.” Here, you will be required to provide the passcode of your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After providing the passcode, select “Other Apps” and check the apps that have Face ID enabled. Remember, you’re unable to manually include apps in the list. Only those apps that have sought access to the feature will appear here automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="access face id and passcode option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?"></a>Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?</h2><p>If you are unable to lock the targeted app directly with Face ID, there is no need to worry. There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won’t directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.</p><p>When activated, it takes you to the lock screen, prompting Face ID, Touch ID, or Passcode to access the Apple iPhone XR device again. Use the following steps to lock your apps using the Shortcuts app:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your Apple iPhone XR, launch the Shortcuts app and select the “Automation” tab from the bottom toolbar. There, tap “New Automation” and use the search bar to look for and select “App.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="choose app automation option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, tap “Choose” in front of the “App” and select the app you want to lock. Now, move down and select “Is Opened,” then move further down to choose “Run Immediately.” Here, leave “Notify when Run” deactivated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="customize app automation settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Proceed forward by tapping “Next” from the top right corner, and on the following screen, tap “New Blank Automation.” Then, press “Add Action” and enter “Lock Screen” into the Search field, then choose “Lock Screen” from the search results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="search for lock screen option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Finally, tap “Done” to finalize the shortcut. Now, upon accessing the targeted app, the shortcut will activate in the background, causing your Apple iPhone XR to be locked. You can then use the Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to unlock it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="press the done option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?"></a>Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?</h2><p>By taking the assistance of Apple’s native Restrictions feature, you can app lock the Apple iPhone XR without any trouble.

To provide added security, you can set up a passcode that is not similar to your lock screen passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can set up an app lock for iPhone using Restrictions. Simply go to General &gt; Restrictions and turn this feature on for any app of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060135059851.jpg"                      alt="turn on restrictions for the app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If you want, then you can also switch this feature off for any app using the same method.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-withoutScreen-Locks-PIN-pattern-fingerprints-face"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-withoutScreen-Locks-PIN-pattern-fingerprints-face" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock iPhone withoutScreen Locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face)"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock iPhone withoutScreen Locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face)</h3><p>It can be a trouble if you forget your Apple iPhone XR passcode since there are many restrictions on using iPhone.

Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone X? And now, you want to disable the Face ID. Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn <strong>how to remove Face ID</strong> on your Apple iPhone X X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-I-What-is-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-I-What-is-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: What is Face ID?"></a>Part I: What is Face ID?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><p>If the new Apple iPhone X is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone X from the 6&#x2F;7&#x2F;8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.</p><p>Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone X 13, the Apple iPhone X 14, and now the Apple iPhone X 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.</p><p>Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.</p><h2 id="Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?"></a>Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?</h2><p>Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone X 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 with Face ID:</p><h3 id="II-I-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-X"><a href="#II-I-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="II.I Unlock Your Apple iPhone X"></a>II.I Unlock Your Apple iPhone X</h3><p>As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-an-iphone-13.html" >unlock your Apple iPhone X 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&#x2F;iPhone 12&#x2F;iPhone 11 with a look. How to do that? Here are the steps:</p><p>Step 1: Pick your Apple iPhone X up in your hands or tap the screen to wake it up.</p><p>Step 2: Look at the iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-2.jpg"                      alt="unlocking iphone 13 with face id"                ></p><p>When the lock symbol changes to the unlocked position, you can swipe up to unlock your Apple iPhone X using Face ID and get to the Home Screen.</p><p>Note that Face ID will not work in landscape mode on an iPhone.</p><h3 id="II-II-Making-Purchases-Using-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-X"><a href="#II-II-Making-Purchases-Using-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="II.II Making Purchases Using Face ID on Your Apple iPhone X"></a>II.II Making Purchases Using Face ID on Your Apple iPhone X</h3><p>Face ID allows you to authenticate yourself to make purchases in the App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store and use Apple Pay wherever supported.</p><h4 id="How-to-use-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-X-to-make-purchases-in-App-Store-Book-Store-and-iTunes-Store"><a href="#How-to-use-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-X-to-make-purchases-in-App-Store-Book-Store-and-iTunes-Store" class="headerlink" title="How to use Face ID on Apple iPhone X to make purchases in App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store"></a>How to use Face ID on Apple iPhone X to make purchases in App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store</h4><p>Step 1: Check if Face ID is enabled for purchases in these stores by going to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and ensuring that iTunes and App Store are toggled On.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="check face id settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: On any of these stores, when you tap on the option to buy some content, a payment confirmation popup will be displayed along with instructions to authenticate yourself using Face ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="make purchases with face id"                ></p><p>The instructions are simple: press the side button twice to authenticate yourself using your Face ID and make the purchase.</p><p>When done, a satisfying ting and a checkmark will confirm the action.</p><h4 id="How-to-use-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-X-to-pay-with-Apple-Pay"><a href="#How-to-use-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-X-to-pay-with-Apple-Pay" class="headerlink" title="How to use Face ID on Apple iPhone X to pay with Apple Pay"></a>How to use Face ID on Apple iPhone X to pay with Apple Pay</h4><p>Step 1: If Apple Pay is supported by banking institutions in your country, you can set it up by adding a supported bank‘s credit card, debit card, or prepaid card to the Wallet app on your Apple iPhone X 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg"                      alt="an apple aard in wallet app"                ></p><p>Step 2: When a card is added and ready to use, check that Apple Pay is enabled under Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 3: For App Store&#x2F; Book Store&#x2F; iTunes Store purchases, it works as always, you double-press the Side Button to authenticate and use your default card.</p><p>Step 4: Look at your Apple iPhone X to authenticate yourself using your Face ID and make the purchase.</p><p>Step 5: When paying at retail outlets, hold your Apple iPhone X (top being close to the reader) and wait for the checkmark and Done message.</p><p>Step 6: To pay using Apple Pay on websites, choose Apple Pay as the payment method, double press the Side Button, look at your Apple iPhone X, and wait for the Done message and checkmark to finish the process.</p><h3 id="II-III-Lowering-Ringer-and-Alarm-Volume-Automatically"><a href="#II-III-Lowering-Ringer-and-Alarm-Volume-Automatically" class="headerlink" title="II.III Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically"></a>II.III Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically</h3><p>Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="attention aware features"                ></p><p>Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt;

Now, when you get a call and your Apple iPhone X 13 is ringing loud, looking at your Apple iPhone X 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your Apple iPhone X. Additionally, your Apple iPhone X screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Filling-Passwords-in-Safari-Automatically-Using-Face-ID"><a href="#II-IV-Filling-Passwords-in-Safari-Automatically-Using-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="II.IV Filling Passwords in Safari Automatically Using Face ID"></a>II.IV Filling Passwords in Safari Automatically Using Face ID</h3><p>Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your Apple iPhone X with Face ID.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.</p><p>Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.</p><p>Step 3: Look at your Apple iPhone X to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.</p><h3 id="II-V-Animojis-and-Memojis"><a href="#II-V-Animojis-and-Memojis" class="headerlink" title="II.V Animojis and Memojis"></a>II.V Animojis and Memojis</h3><p>Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone X X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone X 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone X device in question.

Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working.

Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone’s. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</p><ol><li>Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone X.

As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone X. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone X that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content).

If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature.

It will immediately activate Siri on your Apple iPhone X device. Once it gets activated, it is ready to respond to your voice.

Once it displays the clock on your iOS screen, just touch it to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15090666111442.jpg"                      alt="enable siri"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The World clock appears with the list of tunes you have to select for the alarm clock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15090666366366.jpg"                      alt="open world clock"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From that option, you will see the tab “buy more tunes” which straight away informs you to reach the iTunes store.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15090666562470.jpg"                      alt="click buy more tunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Just click on the home button to go to the phone’s main screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15090666779838.jpg"                      alt="click back"                ></p><p>You will see that you can now access your Apple iPhone X without the passcode as Siri helped unlock iPhone.</p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> This is only used for iOS 10.3.2 and 10.3.3.

What’s more disturbing is that if you keep entering the wrong ones, your Apple iPhone SE (2022) will be locked. It would help if you opened it, be it a 4-digit passcode, 6-digit passcode, Fingerprint, or Face ID.</p><p>If you <strong>forgot passcode on iPhone</strong>, the main thing you can do with your iDevice is to make an Emergency call. You should erase your Apple iPhone SE (2022) if you don’t remember your screen unlock code. But don’t worry; we have many solutions available here. Keep reading to learn about the best tool, i.e., Dr.Fone, for screen unlock.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Unlock-My-iPhone-When-I-Forgot-Passcode"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Unlock-My-iPhone-When-I-Forgot-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Unlock My iPhone When I Forgot Passcode?"></a>Part 1: Can I Unlock My iPhone When I Forgot Passcode?</h2><p>Yes, you can unlock your locked iPhone without a passcode. If you <strong>forgot passcode on iPhone</strong>, Apple’s proper prescribed way is to reset your Apple iPhone SE (2022). In other words, do a factory reset to erase the passcode. However, many individuals can’t do this strategy since it’s irksome and may lead to a few unforeseen issues. Such issues can worsen the condition.</p><p>Therefore, we have introduced some alternate ways to unlock your iDevice. You can even use an expert tool to remove this issue. Keep following us to find out more about our recommended methods.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My"></a>1. Use Find My</h3><p>Utilizing iCloud if the Find My feature is enabled before you <strong>forgot iPhone passcode</strong>. By visiting iCloud.com, you can erase your Apple iPhone SE (2022) from a distance. Moreover, you can eliminate the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s screen lock to unlock it.</p><p>To erase the passcode using the Find My feature on iCloud:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to iCloud.com and enter your Apple account credentials and log in to your account.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pick “Find iPhone” and go to “All Devices” &gt; “Erase iPhone”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="find my"                ></p><h3 id="2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes"></a>2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes</h3><p>How to bypass the Apple iPhone SE (2022) passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone SE (2022) in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device.</p><p>It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.</p><p>Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won’t be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen’s passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn’t so hard. Here’s how to bypass the Apple iPhone SE (2022) passcode with iTunes:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone SE (2022), iPad, or iPod Contact.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>On iPhone 8&#x2F;8 Or later:</strong> Hold the Power&#x2F;Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone SE (2022) transforms into the recovery mode screen.</li><li><strong>On iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Or Below:</strong> Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone SE (2022) to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone SE (2022).</strong></p><p>After connecting your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, “There is an issue with the ‘iPhone name’ that needs it to be restored.” In that window, select “Restore” to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn’t run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up iPhone.</strong></p><p>Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="itunes unlock"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option"><a href="#3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option" class="headerlink" title="3. “Erase iPhone” Option"></a>3. “Erase iPhone” Option</h3><p>However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><p>After several wrong attempts, an “Erase iPhone” choice will appear on the screen’s lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone SE (2022) and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.</p><p>If the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device can’t connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone SE (2022) cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Siri"><a href="#4-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Siri"></a>4. Use Siri</h3><p>You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone SE (2022) passcode.

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone SE (2022) 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone SE (2022)"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone SE (2022)</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone SE (2022) in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.</p><p>Step 5: When done, tap Done.</p><p>In case you are getting the following error:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg"                      alt="face id error"                ></p><p>There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone SE (2022) 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone SE (2022) (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone SE (2022) can be used solely with passcodes if you want. If you find that your screen is locked and you can‘t unlock it, you can always find help in tools such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS). So go ahead, use the new Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) with confidence, and enjoy a more secure experience on your new iPhone than ever before.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone 13&#x2F; iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-apple-iphone-6s-plus-backup-password-heres-what-to-do-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Forgot Apple iPhone 6s Plus Backup Password?

The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared.

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 13 Pro, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 13 Pro.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 13 Pro and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 13 Pro and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 13 Pro was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.</p><h3 id="II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="II.III Put The Apple iPhone 13 Pro in Recovery Mode"></a>II.III Put The Apple iPhone 13 Pro in Recovery Mode</h3><p>You can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro using Recovery Mode, yourself.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro to the computer and open iTunes.

Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="press volume botton"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro and unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro"><a href="#Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 13 Pro"></a>Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 13 Pro</h2><p>If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you’re coming from.

It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 14 Pro based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 14 Pro from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, making it unusable.

Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 14 Pro to the Apple ID used to set it up.

It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.</p><p>It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the <strong>Apple Store “Verification Required”</strong> prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg"                      alt="verification required page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?</h2><p>When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.</p><p>The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.</p><p>What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html"><u>Touch ID</u></a> if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg"                      alt="verification required notification"                ></p><h3 id="Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear"><a href="#Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear"></a>Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear</h3><p>There are several reasons why you might see an <strong>Apple Store’ Verification</strong> <strong>Required</strong>’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:</p><ul><li><strong>New Apple ID</strong>. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.</li><li><strong>Unpaid balance</strong>. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.</li></ul><p>Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID</h2><p>Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:</p><h3 id="Update-Payment-Method"><a href="#Update-Payment-Method" class="headerlink" title="Update Payment Method"></a>Update Payment Method</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the <strong>Settings app</strong>, then go to <strong>Payment &amp; Shipping</strong>. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.</p><h3 id="Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions"><a href="#Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions" class="headerlink" title="Check Unpaid Subscriptions"></a>Check Unpaid Subscriptions</h3><p>Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store &gt; your profile icon, and select <strong>Subscriptions</strong>. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg"                      alt="subscriptions page app store"                ></p><h3 id="Don’t-Require-Password-for-Purchases"><a href="#Don’t-Require-Password-for-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Require Password for Purchases"></a>Don’t Require Password for Purchases</h3><p>For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to <strong>Screen Time</strong>. Under <strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong>, select <strong>iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases</strong>. Here, you can change the settings to <strong>Don’t Require</strong> for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg"                      alt="screen time app store purchases"                ></p><h3 id="Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-and-Re-Sign-In"><a href="#Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-and-Re-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In"></a>Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In</h3><p>Sometimes, simply <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html"><u>signing out of your Apple ID</u></a> and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to <strong>Sign Out</strong>. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.</p><p>Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure. Regularly checking your Apple ID settings and payment information can prevent many common issues with the App Store, including the frustrating ‘Verification Required’ prompt.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Bypass-Verification-Required-Prompt-Without-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Bypass-Verification-Required-Prompt-Without-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Bypass Verification Required Prompt Without Apple ID"></a>Part 3: How To Bypass Verification Required Prompt Without Apple ID</h2><p>If you need to learn <strong>how to bypass the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store</strong> but don’t have access to the Apple ID or password, there’s an alternative approach using third-party software.

Most users prefer this technique, as it doesn’t require a computer and can unlock an iOS device without erasing its data.</p><p>Though, before you proceed, you need to know the limitations of this method. Since it is considered a loophole in iOS, it doesn’t always yield desirable results. It has been observed that the method only works on devices running from iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. To learn how to unlock iPad passcode without a computer, follow these stepwise instructions:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Activate Siri on your iOS device by holding the Home button. Ask for the present time by giving a command like “Hey Siri, what time is it?” to proceed. Siri will let you know the current time by displaying a clock. Tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463688829.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Tap on the Add (plus) icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463891817.jpg"                      alt="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From here, you can search for a city.

Disable Siri from the lock screen</p><p>If someone can’t access Siri from the lock screen, then they won’t be able to follow the above-mentioned process to unlock an iOS device. Therefore, it is highly recommended to disable Siri from the lock screen. To do this, visit your device’s Settings &gt; Touch ID &amp; Passcode, and under the “Allow access when locked” section, disable the option of “Siri.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994466282634.jpg"                      alt="turn off siri" title="turn off siri"                ></p><p>2. Enable Find My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max service</p><p>There are times when users forget to enable the Find My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max feature on their iOS device.

But have you encountered the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed-out</strong> dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations.

Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro? And now, you want to disable the Face ID. Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn <strong>how to remove Face ID</strong> on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-I-What-is-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-I-What-is-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: What is Face ID?"></a>Part I: What is Face ID?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><p>If the new Apple iPhone 11 Pro is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 11 Pro from the 6&#x2F;7&#x2F;8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.</p><p>Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro 14, and now the Apple iPhone 11 Pro 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.</p><p>Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.</p><h2 id="Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?"></a>Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?</h2><p>Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode.

Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 with Face ID:</p><h3 id="II-I-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro"><a href="#II-I-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro" class="headerlink" title="II.I Unlock Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro"></a>II.I Unlock Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro</h3><p>As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-an-iphone-13.html" >unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&#x2F;iPhone 12&#x2F;iPhone 11 with a look.

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.</p><p>Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11:</p><p>Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.</p><p>Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji&#x2F; Memoji you want to send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="recording a memoji"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap the Record button and you now have 30 seconds to do what you want with your face and the character will reproduce it on screen for you.</p><p>Step 4: When done, the Record button changes to Send:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-9.jpg"                      alt="sending a memoji"                ></p><p>Tap Send to send your first Memoji&#x2F; Animoji.</p><h2 id="Part-III-How-to-Remove-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro"><a href="#Part-III-How-to-Remove-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 11 Pro"></a>Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 11 Pro</h2><p>For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro 13 is easy.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt=" ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt=" ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt=" drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 11 Pro in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.
